He wanted to take the guaranteed annuity rate (GAR) and non-GAR elements of his benefits separately. However, Royal London provided incorrect information on multiple occasions, leading Mr. G to believe that he could separate the funds as he intended. After submitting his annuity application, Royal London discovered its error and informed Mr. G that the separation was not possible. This resulted in Mr. G missing out on a potentially higher annuity income and causing him frustration, inconvenience, and additional time spent trying to resolve the issue.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and determined that while Royal London provided incorrect information and made errors, it did take steps to rectify the situation, including providing an apology, feedback to the relevant business area, implementing checks to ensure accurate information is provided to customers, and offering Mr. G a redress of £1,000. The Ombudsman concluded that Royal London's offer of redress was reasonable and that Mr. G was not entitled to the additional compensation he sought.

They claimed on their travel insurance for non-refundable HPB user charges and car hire costs. Great Lakes declined the claim based on a general exclusion in the policy for HPBs.,The Ombudsman found that the exclusion in the policy for HPBs was clear and that it was not unreasonable for Great Lakes to rely on this exclusion to decline the claim. The Ombudsman also found that the car hire costs were less than the excess payable on the policy and therefore it was not unreasonable for Great Lakes to decline to pay these costs either.,Great Lakes Insurance SE

AXA XL agreed that the policy covered the circumstances of the claim but determined that the settlement would be zero because the furlough payments received by B were considered a saving that should be deducted from the claim amount. B disputed this decision, arguing that the furlough payments were not a saving under the policy terms. The complaint was brought to the Financial Ombudsman Service after AXA XL maintained its position.","The Ombudsman considered the terms of B's insurance policy and determined that furlough payments were a saving in respect of charges and expenses payable out of gross profit that ceased or were reduced as a result of the pandemic. The Ombudsman noted that furlough payments were made by the Government to cover part of the cost of paying employees and that B saved on having to pay these wages during the relevant period. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that AXA XL was entitled to deduct the furlough payments from the claim settlement.",AXA XL Insurance Company UK Limited

He complained to HSBC, who said the decision was made by the system and they could not disclose the criteria for the decline. Mr. R then complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and determined that HSBC was not required to guarantee the success of Mr. R's loan application. The letter sent to Mr. R clearly stated that loans are subject to status. The Ombudsman also noted that lending criteria and decisions are solely within the business's discretion and cannot be reviewed by the Ombudsman.

A fraudulent withdrawal of £500 was made before she could report the incident to Barclays. Barclays declined to refund the money, stating that the PIN had been changed and there were multiple log ins to mobile banking. Mrs K disputed this and believed the fraudster must have seen her PIN and changed it.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it was most likely that Mrs K had consented to the payment, either directly or by allowing someone else to use her card. The Ombudsman noted that the genuine card and correct PIN were used for the disputed withdrawal, and that there were balance enquiries made around the same time using the same card. The Ombudsman also considered the time gap between the alleged theft of the card and the disputed withdrawal, as well as the fact that no further attempts were made to withdraw money until over an hour later. Based on these factors, the Ombudsman found it unlikely that the withdrawal was made without Mrs K's consent.",Barclays Bank UK PLC

The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds did not act unreasonably in not stopping the card when Mr R reported it lost, as he was not authorised on the account at that time.

Mr and Mrs N had the roof repaired and provided LV with a letter from the builders stating that the leak had been causing considerable damage for some time. LV maintained its position and declined the claim again. Mr and Mrs N complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that LV should have investigated the leak in the main water supply when Mr and Mrs N provided them with the letter from the builders. LV's surveyor had noted water damage to ground floor areas, rather than nearer the roof, and a chemical analysis of the water in the insulation indicated that the moisture was from an ongoing issue.

However, the Ombudsman considered that Aviva's decision to cancel the policy was fair and in line with CIDRA, as they would not have offered the policy if they had known about the cocaine use.

C&G denied the claim on the grounds that it was related to a pre-existing condition of left hind leg lameness that had not been disclosed on the insurance application. The complainant disputed this, arguing that B had only suffered skinned pads in 2020 and that the current lameness was a new issue.",The Ombudsman found that there was no evidence to support C&G's claim that B had lameness attributable to a cruciate issue in 2020. The Ombudsman also noted that the vet who treated B in 2022 had expressed the opinion that the current condition was not connected to any previous condition.

HSBC should have contacted Mrs N to check that the funds were not being transferred as part of a scam.

Markerstudy applied a proportional settlement to his claim for a stolen and recovered motorbike, arguing that the bike was not garaged as stated and that a different policy with a higher premium would have been offered if accurate information had been provided. Mr Z disputed this and complained to the Ombudsman.","The Ombudsman found that Markerstudy had acted fairly and reasonably in applying a proportional settlement based on the incorrect information provided. While Mr Z believed his description of the parking space as a garage was reasonable, the Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by Markerstudy, including photos of the parking area, and concluded that the space did not meet the definition of a garage and posed a higher risk.

He made the payments in branch, stating that they were for home improvements and to fix his home, as instructed by the agent. He later realised that he had been the victim of a scam and reported it to Barclays, who reimbursed him 50% of the money he had lost under the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code (CRM Code).","The Ombudsman found that the complainant did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the payments were genuine or that the person he was transacting with was legitimate. He had not taken sufficient steps to verify the identity of the agent or the legitimacy of the payments, and should have been more cautious given the large amount of money involved.

The mortgage was on an initial fixed-interest rate until 31 August 2009, after which it moved onto NatWest's SVR. Mr and Mrs B allege that NatWest's SVR was not fairly applied and that they were charged an excessive interest rate. They argue that the variation terms in their mortgage contract were unfair and that NatWest breached certain FCA principles and rules.","The Ombudsman considered the relevant law and regulations, including the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations (UTCCR), and concluded that the variation terms in Mr and Mrs B's mortgage contract were not unfair. The Ombudsman also found that NatWest had legitimate reasons to vary the SVR in the way that it did, taking into account the impact of the financial crisis on its cost of funding. The Ombudsman concluded that there was no basis to say that Mr and Mrs B were charged an unfairly high rate of interest on their mortgage and dismissed the complaint.",National Westminster Bank Plc

They noticed some damp in their property and a plumber located a leak from a pipe. They claimed for the damage, but AA said it wasn't covered because the damp ought to have been evident for some time, and therefore it'd be considered as gradual damage which isn't covered by the policy. An investigator looked into the matter and felt that AA had been reasonable in declining the claim for the damage caused by the escape of water itself. But they felt the policy ought to cover the trace and access costs involved. Mr and Mrs P agreed that was fair, but AA said the fact that the escape of water claim was declined means that the trace and access costs weren't covered either.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's conclusions that the policy provides cover for trace and access costs and that it doesn't stipulate that any further claim for damage caused beyond this needs to have been accepted for the trace and access to be covered. Therefore, even though it may have been reasonable to reject the claim for damage caused by the escape of water, it doesn't follow that the damage caused by the trace and access work shouldn't be covered as well.",AA Underwriting Insurance Company Limited

However, as Mr. K's financial difficulties were considered long-term, Lloyds Bank PLC was required to record the arrears on his credit file.

DAS confirmed that in July 2023 it paid the panel solicitors a final payment of £22,140 (reduced from £36,258). DAS also recently provided a copy of the final judgment on Mr W's employment claim, which was dismissed. DAS said that in light of the judgement, cover was withdrawn and it was also withdrawing its offer to pay Mr W the residual amount of the indemnity limit.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that DAS's decision to pay Mr W the value of the claim was not unreasonable. The solicitors advised that £15,000 would have been a reasonable settlement and there is no legal assessment of Mr W's chances of achieving a successful outcome to his tribunal claim. The Ombudsman also considered the offer in June 2022 to be reasonable and does not think that DAS was required to agree to another solicitor under the policy or paying for the panel solicitors to do any other work. The Ombudsman acknowledged that the delay in DAS finalising its position will have been frustrating for Mr W, but does not think that Mr W has acted in any different way in reliance on DAS's offer in June 2022. The Ombudsman therefore does not consider that any compensation is warranted for the time taken to finalise the costs position with the solicitors and make its final decision about any further offer.",DAS Legal Expenses Insurance Company Limited

Santander obtained a report from an independent engineer who concluded that the car had an excessive oil level and that this could not have been the position at the point of supply. Mrs B was unhappy with this and referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered that Santander had not acted reasonably in relying on the engineer's report as evidence that the car was of satisfactory quality when supplied. He noted that there was a clear record of Mrs B having reported the limp mode issue on several occasions very soon after she got the car. He also considered that the problems Mrs B experienced with the car indicated that it was not of satisfactory quality, even taking into account its age and mileage.

He claims that he was quoted an ERC of around £5,400 over the phone, but the mortgage offer he received showed an ERC of 2% of the loan amount, which would have been £3,860.

The Ombudsman also found that Barclays' ERC calculation method is fair and in line with the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) Mortgage Conduct of Business (MCOB) rules. The Ombudsman acknowledged that Mr T believes the EU Mortgage Credit Directive supersedes the FCA's MCOB rules, but noted that the FCA has not deemed it necessary to change MCOB in this regard.",Barclays Bank UK PLC

Mr. S argues that this action is unfair, while Santander asserts that it is necessary to protect its security interest.","The ombudsman acknowledges that the prospect of losing one's home is distressing, but emphasizes the need to consider Santander's perspective and the risk to its security.

She obtained a mortgage illustration in May 2022 showing an interest rate of 2.55%, but the interest rate had increased by the time she had an appointment with a mortgage adviser in June 2022. Miss E believes that if she had been given an earlier appointment, she could have remortgaged sooner and secured a lower interest rate. She complained to NatWest about the delay and requested that the ERC be waived, but NatWest did not uphold her complaint.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and determined that it is normal industry practice for interest rates quoted in mortgage illustrations to not be guaranteed and that a mortgage offer must be made before a customer can rely on the terms. The mortgage illustration provided to Miss E clearly stated that the interest rate was valid only for the day it was issued and that it may change with market conditions. The Ombudsman also noted that Miss E could have pursued a mortgage with other lenders at any time and that she chose to wait for an appointment with NatWest.

Hiscox accepted the claim for a certain period but declined to pay for ongoing restrictions after July 2020. T argued that the restrictions continued to impact its business and that Hiscox should cover the losses. Hiscox maintained that the policy didn't cover the ongoing losses and that any new restrictions after the policy renewal in May 2020 would require a new claim under a different policy.","The Ombudsman considered the policy terms and the restrictions in place during the relevant period. It was determined that the indemnity period under the policy ended in July 2020 when the initial lockdown regulations were revoked. While there were still restrictions on gatherings and events, the Ombudsman found that these would be considered new restrictions under a new policy period. Since T's policy didn't cover Covid-19 for the new period, the Ombudsman concluded that Hiscox's decision to cease paying the claim from July 2020 was fair and reasonable.",Hiscox Insurance Company Limited

This caused the solicitors to spend time identifying the payment, and the cost was passed on to the estate.","The Ombudsman agreed that Lloyds should have included the exact reference requested by the solicitor when making the payment and therefore agreed to reimburse the requested costs to the estate.

Lloyds said it would give Mr and Mrs B until 17 March 2021, to transfer any direct debits from the business account to a personal account.

There were difficulties in contacting Ms. N to arrange repairs, and the claim file was closed in May 2018. Ms. N complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and the complaint was initially dealt with by an investigator in September 2018. The investigator suggested that Ms. N contact RSA to arrange for repairs and stated that it was not reasonable for RSA to pay laundry costs since she had received a payment for damaged contents including a washer/dryer. RSA reopened the claim and arranged for different contractors to assess the damage. There were further delays due to difficulties in scheduling appointments with the contractors. In May 2019, Ms. N instructed solicitors who wrote to RSA in August 2019 stating that the claim had not progressed. RSA reappointed the loss adjusters who carried out a site visit in November 2019.

The Ombudsman also considered the regulations (Payment Services Regulations 2017, PSRs) and concluded that Barclays were not obliged to check any of the additional information provided with the payment instruction.

He was unhappy that Nationwide closed his account without notice and felt that they could have done more to protect him.",The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that Nationwide was entitled to close Mr B's account without notice in the circumstances. The Ombudsman noted that Mr B was arrested after the incident in branch and that the branch manager's statement to the police suggested that Mr B was threatening staff and customers.

Mr. B disputed this, claiming that the messages were from Barclays and that the bank was dishonest in denying responsibility.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by both parties and concluded that it was more likely that the issues experienced by Mr. B were due to market conditions and not a fault in Barclays' systems. The Ombudsman noted that Barclays had provided evidence of a suspension in trading of S shares around the time of Mr. B's attempted trade, which aligned with other information about market volatility for S on that day.

Santander declined to refund the withdrawals as they were reported more than 13 months after they occurred, as per their terms and conditions. Miss A complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, arguing that Santander should have investigated further.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Santander was not obliged to refund the withdrawals as they were reported more than 13 months after they occurred, as per the Payment Services Regulations and Santander's terms and conditions. The Ombudsman also noted that Santander did investigate the withdrawals and concluded that they were likely authorized by Miss A, as they were made with her genuine card and PIN and there was no obvious point of compromise. While the Ombudsman acknowledged that Miss A didn't check her statements at the time and that the withdrawals were larger than her usual transactions, he found that they were not sufficiently unusual or large enough to justify Santander stopping them at the time. The Ombudsman also noted that banks rely on customers reporting disputed transactions promptly to preserve evidence. Although Santander initially declined to refund the withdrawals due to the time lapse, the Ombudsman commended their subsequent investigation and conclusion that the transactions were likely authorized by Miss A. The Ombudsman also addressed Miss A's concerns about Santander's investigation methods, explaining that banks commonly examine card activity around the time of disputed transactions to establish what might have happened. Ultimately, the Ombudsman concluded that there was no further action Santander could take and therefore did not uphold the complaint.",Santander UK Plc

Lloyds Bank PLC contends that it carried out appropriate checks and that Miss L's income and expenditure at the time of the applications indicated that she could afford the repayments.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by both Miss L and Lloyds Bank PLC and concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC did not do anything wrong when deciding to lend to Miss L. The Ombudsman noted that Lloyds Bank PLC carried out proportionate checks and reasonably relied on the information it obtained, which suggested that the repayments were affordable. The Ombudsman also considered the fact that the second loan was provided in circumstances where Miss L's indebtedness did not appear to be increasing unsustainably.",Lloyds Bank PLC

Ms. G complained to Aviva about the lack of communication and the increased premium, but Aviva only offered her £50 as a gesture of goodwill.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that Aviva had the right to make changes to the policy at renewal and that the premium increase was calculated correctly. However, he also recognized that Aviva's failure to communicate the changes clearly caused Ms. G distress and inconvenience.

The Ombudsman also considered that it was likely that some marketing emails were sent to the ex-partner, but that no more sensitive data was shared.

Mrs. M disagreed, stating that she was not informed about the dealer deposit contribution and that the amount she agreed to sell her previous car for was dependent on her keeping the newer car.","The Ombudsman found that there was no dealer deposit contribution and that the manufacturer had paid funds to the dealer, who then used the funds to buy Mrs. M's car.

The Ombudsman considered that the damage to the septic tank had been happening gradually and that Mr and Mrs A could not have reasonably known about the cause of the damage.

She complained to Ageas, who upheld her complaint. Miss M remained unhappy and asked the Financial Ombudsman Service to investigate.","The Ombudsman found that Ageas had not offered Miss M a courtesy car in line with her policy and had not fully explained the options when offering a hire car.

They emphasized that esure should restore the consumer's position as far as possible and considered the impact of the error on Mr. B.

They also highlighted the month-long delay in resolving the matter with the police, which they attributed to esure's error rather than Mr. B's actions.

The policy defines an insured location as a private garden that is directly connected to the main place of residence and is not accessible to the public. The communal garden where the bike was stored does not meet these criteria as it is accessible to all residents and is primarily used for parking vehicles.,Watford Insurance Company Europe Limited

Barclays initially credited her account with the £300 but later reversed the credit after their investigation concluded that the withdrawals were authorised. Miss F complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service when Barclays maintained their position.,"The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it did not support Miss F's claim that the withdrawals were unauthorised. He noted that Miss F's genuine card and PIN would have been required for the withdrawals and that there was no evidence to suggest that a third party had obtained her PIN. He also considered the fact that Barclays had refunded and then re-debited the £300 from Miss F's account twice, but found that this was in accordance with the terms of her account. Overall, the Ombudsman found that Barclays' conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to support third-party involvement in the disputed withdrawals was fair and reasonable, and that there was no basis to direct Barclays to pay compensation or take further action.",Barclays Bank UK PLC

The Ombudsman also found that it was misleading for British Gas to call it an annual service when it only involved a visual check of the water cylinder and would not be in line with the manufacturer's instructions.

The Ombudsman noted that the merchant had provided evidence that the dress was ordered to a standard size and that Ms B's daughter had not been to see the seamstress to have the dress adjusted.

The complainant subsequently complained that a bathroom tile that was not in the vicinity of the repair had been damaged by the engineer. Astrenska denied liability for the damage, but the Ombudsman found that it was more likely than not that the damage was caused by the engineer and that Astrenska was therefore responsible for putting it right.","The Ombudsman considered the photographs provided by the complainant, which showed the bathroom floor prior to the engineer attending and then after the repair had been carried out.

The Ombudsman concluded that this evidence satisfied him that the damage was more likely than not caused by the engineer. The Ombudsman also considered Astrenska's argument that it was unfair to hold it responsible for damage that was possibly caused unknowingly by the engineer, but found that this was not a valid defence as Astrenska was responsible for putting right any damage caused by its contractors, regardless of whether or not they were aware of the damage.",Astrenska Insurance Limited

However, the Ombudsman found that there was no obligation on HSBC to warn customers about this at the time the transfer was made.

The Ombudsman noted that it is for a business to decide what risks they're prepared to cover and how much weight to attach to those risks, and that different insurers will apply different factors. The Ombudsman also noted that the increase in excess was driven by Aviva's underwriting criteria, which set out an insurer's risk appetite, and that it is not unfair for an insurer to apply any of these terms without any negotiation with a consumer.",Aviva Insurance Limited

Mr I obtained a barrister's opinion which concluded that an element of his claim (relating to disability discrimination) did have reasonable prospects of success. Fairmead agreed to seek a further opinion on prospects in January and provided funding to protect Mr I's position while that was done. However, the further opinion was also unsupportive and cover was withdrawn.

The rate was fixed at 1.69% until 2 November 2023, with an ERC being due if the mortgage was repaid before that date. In 2022, Mr C complained to Santander about the ERC, but Santander did not uphold the complaint. Mr C then referred the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service. In the meantime, Mr C made lump sum payments of around £22,100 in December 2022 and £19,900 in January 2023, and then he redeemed the remaining mortgage of around £179,000 when he sold the property for £465,000 in January 2023 incurring an ERC of around £5,400.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint. The Ombudsman noted that the ERC was set out in the mortgage offer in a way that should have been readily understandable to Mr C and that Santander was entitled to set an ERC based not on the actual cost to it of Mr C ending his own mortgage early, but on a reasonable pre-estimate of the costs of early termination of a group of mortgages of similar type. The Ombudsman also noted that Santander had provided evidence to show how it pre-estimated the costs of this group of mortgages being repaid early and that the ERC reflects its costs of setting up and servicing the mortgage, the cost of the capital it has to set aside, the cost of funding the fixed rate, the cost of financial instruments that could be used to protect its position (and unwinding those) and its future losses.

She was advised that it would take three to five days for RSA's contractor to attend, but she decided to proceed with a private contractor (P) due to the urgency of the situation. RSA's claims advisor did not clearly explain the potential financial implications of using a private contractor. Engineers from RSA's appointed contractor (C) visited the property and suggested the installation of a manhole cover, which Ms. L understood to be necessary based on their advice. Ms. L submitted invoices totaling £44,836.02 for the repair work, but RSA's payments fell significantly short of this amount. Ms. L complained to RSA, arguing that she would have waited for RSA's contractor if she had been fully informed about the policy terms and potential cost differences.","The Ombudsman found that RSA's claims advisor failed to provide clear and sufficient information about the potential financial implications of using a private contractor, which prejudiced Ms. L's position. The Ombudsman also considered that C's engineers should have clarified that they could take over the repairs, potentially saving Ms. L from having to cover the cost difference. The Ombudsman concluded that RSA's poor handling of the claim caused Ms. L distress and inconvenience, and that the fair and reasonable outcome would be for RSA to pay the difference between what Ms. L paid for the repairs and what RSA had already paid, along with interest and a compensation payment for distress and inconvenience.",Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited

The Ombudsman also found that RSA's decision not to provide cover was based on the legal advice it received and was made in line with the policy terms.,Royal & Sun Alliance Insurance Limited

Santander initially provided incorrect reasons for the declined payments and later stated that the issue was with the card S held until May 2022. S claims to have raised the issue with Santander as early as October 2021, but Santander's records show the complaint being made in October 2022. Despite a card replacement in May 2022, S still faced problems in registering the card on B's website.","The Ombudsman found that Santander failed to provide a clear justification for preventing the transactions prior to May 2022 and did not adequately assist S in resolving the issue. While S could have mitigated its losses by opening an account with a different bank, Santander should have provided an accurate explanation and potential solution earlier. The Ombudsman also considered that Santander should have informed S that the card change might not resolve the problem, which it failed to do.",Santander UK Plc

HSBC initially stated that funds remained in the account but later confirmed that only €17.50 was left. The complainant argued that HSBC should have detected and stopped the suspicious activity on the recipient account and that they failed to provide adequate warnings about scams.",The Ombudsman found that HSBC did not adequately monitor the recipient account and failed to take action when a significant outgoing payment was made soon after the arrival of the complainant's funds. The Ombudsman considered that HSBC should have been on heightened alert due to the large incoming payment to a low-income customer and the mismatch between the beneficiary name and the account holder's name. The Ombudsman also found that the complainant did not contribute to the loss and was not aware of any potential problems at the time of the payment.,HSBC UK Bank Plc
