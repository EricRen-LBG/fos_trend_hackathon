She complained that Lloyds Bank should have done more to protect her money and should have acted sooner to prevent the scam.,"The Ombudsman considered that the payments were authorised under the Payment Services Regulations 2017, even though Ms A may not have made them all herself. The Ombudsman also considered that even if Lloyds Bank had flagged the payments as unusual and stepped in sooner, it is unlikely that it could have prevented Ms A's loss. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds Bank is not to blame for Ms A's losses.",Lloyds Bank PLC

The bank initially agreed to a six-month repayment plan but refused to extend it further, leading to the closure of his account and registration of a default. Mr. T argued that he relied on the repayment plans and that the bank's communication was unclear.","The Ombudsman found that the bank was entitled to call in the overdraft and that the short-term repayment plans were not a sustainable solution. However, the bank's communication regarding the removal of the temporary overdraft facility was unclear and caused distress to Mr. T. Therefore, the Ombudsman awarded Mr. T £100 in compensation.",Lloyds Bank PLC

He later realized it was a scam and reported it to Lloyds. Lloyds did not reimburse or recover his funds, prompting him to file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and determined that Lloyds was not reasonably expected to prevent the payments as they were authorized by Mr. H. While Lloyds should have taken proactive steps to identify and prevent potentially fraudulent transactions, the payments did not appear sufficiently unusual or uncharacteristic to warrant intervention. Additionally, the Ombudsman found that the payments were not recoverable through Lloyds once they had been made as the merchant, Simplex, legitimately provided the intended services.",Lloyds Bank PLC

The bank declined the transfer and asked her to visit a branch with identification due to concerns about potential fraud. Mrs P felt that the bank's actions were unnecessary and caused her financial loss.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Lloyds Bank acted reasonably in requesting additional security checks before processing the transfer. The bank has a duty to protect its customers from potential fraud and scams, and the measures taken were in line with its fraud prevention policies. While the delay may have been inconvenient for Mrs P, the Ombudsman found no fault with the bank's motivation or course of action.",Lloyds Bank PLC

Mr. K claims he was unaware of the BBL until May 2021 when the bank required repayment. He states he closed the business account in March 2020 and informed the bank about stolen personal documents. Lloyds maintains that the account was open and used, and that Mr. K was aware of the loan from the outset.","The Ombudsman found that there was no evidence to support Mr. K's claim that he closed the business account in March 2020 or reported stolen documents to the bank. Statements show that the account remained open and transactions continued until mid-May 2020. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds sent Mr. K information about the bank account and the BBL to his address and phone, and that there was no evidence of how a third party could have taken control of the account, applied for the BBL, and spent the funds without Mr. K's knowledge. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds did not act unfairly or unreasonably in pursuing Mr. K for repayment of the BBL.",Lloyds Bank PLC

They also said that the monthly payment was wrong and that Lloyds was not answering their questions about the mortgage. The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank PLC had remediated the mortgage in line with the FCA guidance and that there was no evidence of any mistake in calculating the monthly payment.,The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that there was no evidence that Lloyds Bank PLC had not remediated the mortgage correctly. The Ombudsman noted that the mortgage remains significantly in arrears and that Lloyds Bank PLC is not required to communicate with Mr and Mrs O further in regard to this complaint.,Lloyds Bank PLC

Lloyds declined her claim as the payments were made using her device and she had advised no one had access to her card or phone. She later explained that her friend had made the payments without her knowledge and thought her friend was a victim of a scam. Lloyds said they would need a police report to reassess the claim.,"The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by both parties and found it more likely than not that Ms B authorised or consented to the disputed transactions. The payments were made from her device and IP address, and she had not provided sufficient evidence to support her claim that her friend had made the payments without her knowledge or consent.",Lloyds Bank PLC

Upon counting the money at home, they found it to be £800 short. Lloyds Bank investigated but found no discrepancies or till errors. The Ombudsman reviewed the case and agreed with the bank's findings.","The Ombudsman considered the cashbox and TCR totals, which balanced on the day of the transaction. The fact that Mrs E received the two £10 notes dispatched at the end of the transaction also indicates that the full withdrawal occurred. The 2-week gap between the transaction and the discovery of the discrepancy raises the possibility of third-party access to the envelope. CCTV footage was deemed unlikely to provide conclusive evidence as it faces the customer rather than the cashier. Based on the available evidence, the Ombudsman found it difficult to determine with certainty what happened and concluded that Lloyds Bank was not required to take any further action.",Lloyds Bank PLC

Mrs. R complained that the bank should have held the currency for longer or informed her about the deadline more clearly.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Lloyds Bank had acted fairly and reasonably. The bank had extended the deadline for collecting the currency on multiple occasions and had communicated with Mrs. R about the situation. While the Ombudsman acknowledged Mrs. R's ill health, they determined that Lloyds was not responsible for the exchange rate loss.",Lloyds Bank PLC

He complained to Lloyds Bank PLC, arguing that they should have detected the fraud and prevented the payment, or at least done more to recover the funds. Lloyds Bank PLC declined to refund the money.","The Ombudsman considered the Payment Services Regulations 2009 and found that Lloyds Bank PLC was expected to execute authorised payment instructions without undue delay. It was not in dispute that Mr G was scammed, but he had also authorised the disputed payment. The Ombudsman also considered whether Lloyds Bank PLC should have realised Mr G was at risk from fraud and failed to intervene appropriately, but found that the payment value and destination did not stand out as particularly unusual. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC was not at fault for failing to stop or recover Mr G's losses and therefore could not be held liable.",Lloyds Bank PLC

He claims that Lloyds Bank should have detected and prevented these fraudulent transactions.","The Ombudsman considered the chargeback scheme rules and the time limits involved, concluding that a chargeback was not a viable option. While the larger payment of £4,958.56 stood out, it was not unreasonable for Lloyds' fraud prevention systems not to be triggered. Therefore, the Ombudsman found that Lloyds was not responsible for Mr. B's loss and did not have to issue a refund.",Lloyds Bank PLC

Lloyds responded that they rely on their account holders to provide accurate contact information and that they had taken steps to ensure no further correspondence addressed to the third-party would be received by Mr and Mrs K. However, Mr and Mrs K continued to receive letters addressed to the third-party and referred their complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.",The Ombudsman found that Mr and Mrs K were not eligible complainants in regard to the Lloyd's accounts held by the third-party and that the only aspect of their complaint that the Ombudsman could consider was whether Lloyds had enabled or facilitated the third-party using Mr and Mrs K's address. The Ombudsman found no evidence to suggest that Lloyds had provided the third-party with Mr and Mrs K's address information and therefore did not uphold the complaint.,Lloyds Bank PLC

Following a building inspection, it was found that the work did not meet the expected standard. Miss B reported the incident to the police and contacted Lloyds Bank PLC to request a refund of the payments, which was declined. Miss B then filed a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that there was insufficient proof to establish that Mr D intended to defraud Miss B from the outset. The payments were made as a result of a civil dispute rather than a scam, and therefore Lloyds Bank PLC was not liable for the losses incurred by Miss B.",Lloyds Bank PLC

However, his business later failed, and the bank demanded repayment of the loan. Mr. N complained that the bank should not have approved the loan as his business was already failing and would not have passed affordability checks. The bank maintained that it had carried out adequate checks and that Mr. N met the criteria.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that the bank had carried out sufficient checks before approving the CBIL. The Ombudsman noted that the CBIL scheme was designed to provide swift financial assistance to businesses during the pandemic, and detailed manual checks were not expected. The Ombudsman also considered the representations made by Mr. N in his application and the information available from his bank account statements, which indicated that the business met the bank's lending criteria. The Ombudsman acknowledged the complainant's difficult circumstances but concluded that the bank had not acted wrongly in lending under the CBIL scheme at the time.",Lloyds Bank PLC

He alleged that Lloyds did not conduct proper affordability checks before approving the loans, leading to financial difficulties. Lloyds maintained that they had carried out the necessary checks and that Mr D's income and expenditure at the time indicated that the loans were affordable.","The Ombudsman found that while reasonable and proportionate checks may not have been completed by Lloyds in relation to the two loans, they made fair lending decisions based on the information obtained. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds responded to Mr D with forbearance and due consideration once it was aware that he was in financial difficulty.

Mr. E complained that this was unfair as he believed he had sufficient means to repay the borrowing and had a good payment history. Lloyds explained that they regularly review credit limits and based on their assessment, they found it may have been difficult for Mr. E to repay the amount he was borrowing. They also conducted a financial review in January 2023 but were unable to increase the limit due to adverse information on Mr. E's credit file.",The Ombudsman agreed with Lloyds Bank's decision as the terms and conditions of Mr. E's credit card account allowed the bank to change the credit limit at any time. The bank followed the correct process by informing Mr. E about the reduction on the same day and providing a reason for it. The Ombudsman also acknowledged that Lloyds conducted a financial review and explained the reasons for not being able to increase the credit limit at that time.,Lloyds Bank PLC

Lloyds didnt uphold Miss Ls complaint. It says from the information Miss L provided all overdrafts were affordable and all applications passed its internal and credit checks. Lloyds believes the overdraft was manageable as the statements show it was non-essential spending that caused the account to become overdrawn.,The Ombudsman agreed with the adjudicator that when Miss L took out a loan in November 2018 to pay off her overdraft that ought to have been a sign that she wasn't able to manage her overdraft and was having to go into more debt to pay off her existing debt.

However, the investigator also found that the directors had not suffered any financial detriment as a result of Lloyds' actions.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's findings and concluded that Lloyds had not provided suitable advice to the directors.

In this case, Mr H has been left with an outstanding balance on his overdraft, once all adjustments have been made, and he's been refunded all of the interest, fees and charges caused by his overdraft.

Mrs J brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.",The Ombudsman considered whether the complaint was brought within the time limits and found that it was. The Ombudsman noted that passbooks offer a snapshot of an account at a particular point in time and the lack of further entries does not prove an account remains open or that there were no further withdrawals.

He argued that he would not have purchased the extra points if he had known this.","The Ombudsman found that there was insufficient evidence to support Mr. B's claims of misrepresentation and that it was not clear whether the governing law of the contract was English or Spanish.

However, the Ombudsman did not find evidence to support the claim that the account was mis-sold.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and concluded that it was more likely Mr. J agreed to the Gold Service account for the preferential interest rates on loans and overdrafts rather than because he thought it was his only option to get a loan.

Lloyds Bank Plc also raised a Direct Debit Indemnity claim with the energy supplier, but the energy supplier provided evidence which successfully challenged the claim.",The Ombudsman found that the Direct Debit Guarantee is not designed to deal with contractual disputes between a customer and the originator of a direct debit.

The Ombudsman also noted that Miss L spent the credit provided by Lloyds Bank PLC and that she was left with a balance to repay after all adjustments were made. The Ombudsman concluded that it was fair and reasonable to expect Miss L to repay these funds and that her unhappiness at having a balance to repay was not a compelling reason to depart from the usual approach to putting things right in such cases.",Lloyds Bank PLC

The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds should have left the direct debit in place, as it caused inconvenience to Miss R and Mr S. The Ombudsman awarded Miss R and Mr S £500 compensation for the additional upset and worry caused by Lloyds' collections activity between mid-October 2022 and May 2023.",Lloyds Bank PLC

The account was eventually opened in September 2022 after S resubmitted the application. S alleges that the delay caused them to miss out on funding opportunities.","The Ombudsman found that while there were some communication issues and delays on Lloyds' part, S also contributed to the delay by not promptly following up on the application after the initial call.

Lloyds has provided evidence that Mr B didn't make the monthly payments to his credit card for some time from November 2022 onward. As a result, Lloyds recorded those missing payments and applied charges, and reported this on his credit file. Mr B feels that Lloyds treated him unfairly regarding his S75 claim against the merchant, but the Ombudsman finds that this does not excuse him from his obligation to pay what he owed Lloyds on a monthly basis. Lloyds also changed how it approached matters and passed Mr B's account to its collections team after he failed to make the required payments. Subsequently, Lloyds reduced Mr B's credit limit after reviewing his account and considering factors such as the management of the account.","The Ombudsman finds that Lloyds has acted fairly in managing Mr B's credit card account. Mr B was notified of arrears, contacted by the collections team, and had his credit limit reduced because he failed to make the required monthly payments. The Ombudsman acknowledges that Mr B is disputing a transaction with a merchant, but this does not absolve him from his responsibility to pay what he owes Lloyds.

Ms. C urgently needed the card as she was traveling overseas on January 3, 2023, but Lloyds informed her that they could not expedite the delivery due to postal strike action and the Christmas holiday period. She received the replacement card only on January 10, 2023, causing inconvenience and requiring her to borrow money from family members.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the frustration experienced by Ms. C but concluded that Lloyds had acted reasonably under the circumstances. The delay in receiving the replacement card was primarily due to factors beyond Lloyds' control, such as the postal strike and the holiday period. Lloyds had followed their standard process for issuing replacement debit cards and had offered alternative solutions, such as transferring funds to another account and using the card online, which Ms. C declined.

While Mr R was the victim of a scam, he did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the seller was genuine.

The complainants felt they were not informed about this issue earlier, causing them stress and financial difficulties.","The Ombudsman acknowledged Lloyds' initial poor service and offered £150 as compensation. However, the main issue arose from the mortgage advisor's failure to communicate the property details accurately, which could have resulted in an earlier decision from Lloyds.
