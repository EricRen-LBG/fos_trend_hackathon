The complainants allege they were not properly notified of the account closure and that a default was unfairly registered on their credit file.,"The Ombudsman found that Barclays acted reasonably in closing the account and registering the default. The bank had sent the termination notice and communicated the consequences of non-payment to the complainants. The Ombudsman also considered the calls between the bank and Mr. P, which confirmed that he was informed about the termination process."
DRN-3611804,Mr K,Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard,Banking,Barclaycard's handling of his chargeback claim and declining his section 75 claim.,Barclaycard,"['chargeback', 'section 75', 'deposit refund']","['chargeback process', 'section 75 claim assessment', 'contractual agreement']",1479.2,,Dont uphold,Emma Davy,20 March 2023,Supplier failed to refund deposit after the complainant's finance application was approved.,"The complainant believed there was an agreement with the supplier that the deposit would be refunded if the finance was approved, and that this was misrepresented.",The complainant wanted a refund of his deposit and for Barclaycard to reconsider their decision on his section 75 claim.,"Mr. K paid a deposit of £1479.20 using his Barclaycard for a new kitchen installation. He claims that the supplier agreed to refund the deposit if his finance application was approved, which was later confirmed in an email. Despite his finance being approved, the refund was not processed. Barclaycard initially processed a chargeback but it was challenged by the supplier. Barclaycard also declined the section 75 claim as they didn't find evidence of a breach of contract or misrepresentation.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that there was no misrepresentation or breach of contract. The supplier's terms and conditions stated that the contract formed the whole agreement and there was no reference to a refund of the deposit. While the complainant's email suggested an agreement for a refund, the contemporaneous documentation did not support this. Therefore, the Ombudsman found that Barclaycard acted fairly and reasonably in handling the chargeback and section 75 claims."

He also wanted Barclays to acknowledge that the previous £250 compensation was for a different issue and not intended as compensation for all future complaints.,"Mr T identified errors in his CTCs where dividend distributions were not split between cash and interest elements, potentially leading to incorrect tax payments. He complained to Barclays, which acknowledged the issue but stated that resolving it would require a full platform restructuring and could not provide a timeline. Mr T remained dissatisfied and brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the inconvenience caused to Mr T and recognized Barclays' efforts to address the issue. However, the Ombudsman considered that Barclays had taken reasonable steps to inform Mr T of the situation and offered a workaround in the form of a personalized letter confirming the dividend/interest position. The Ombudsman also noted that it was not within their power to prescribe how a firm should run its business or operate its services. While understanding Mr T's frustration, the Ombudsman concluded that Barclays' actions were fair and reasonable under the circumstances and declined to uphold the complaint."

She made multiple payments from her Barclays account as well as from accounts with another bank. Barclays held back the first payment and spoke to Mrs. L about it, but she lied about the purpose of the payment and denied getting any assistance with the investment. She continued to make payments despite Barclays' warnings about investment scams. When she realized she had been scammed, she reported it to Barclays, who said they were not liable for the losses because she had authorized the payments.",The Ombudsman found that Barclays was not liable for Mrs. L's losses because she had authorized the payments and had not been honest with Barclays about the purpose of the payments. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had taken appropriate steps to warn Mrs. L about investment scams and had not acted unreasonably in releasing the payments.

Barclays blocked some of the payments but Ms M was uncooperative and continued making payments despite Barclays' warnings. Barclays did not uphold the complaint as Ms M authorised the payments and Barclays provided meaningful warnings.","The Ombudsman considered that Ms M authorised the payments and Barclays took steps to identify and prevent suspicious transactions. While Barclays could have done more, Ms M's uncooperative behaviour and lack of truthfulness contributed to the loss. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint."
DRN-3808597,Mr F,Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard,Banking,Barclays Bank unfairly passed his account to a third-party company for collection following a default.,Credit card,"['Default', 'Permanent hold', 'Vulnerable customer']","['Account management', 'Communication between the bank and the customer', 'Debt collection']",,,not upholding,Jocelyn Griffith,14 February 2023,The complaint relates to Barclaycard passing Mr. F's account to a third-party company for collection after he defaulted on his payments.,Mr. F believed that Barclaycard had agreed to put his account on a permanent hold and that they had promised not to pass his debt to a third-party for collection.,Mr. F wanted Barclaycard to acknowledge that they had agreed to put his account on a permanent hold and to stop the debt collection process.,"Mr. F had a credit card account with Barclaycard and experienced financial difficulties in January 2018, which made him unable to maintain his payments. He contacted Barclaycard and claims that they agreed to put his account on a permanent hold for six months, after which it would be defaulted without incurring any interest or charges. However, in December 2021, Mr. F was informed that his account had been transferred to a third-party company for collection.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it was unlikely that Barclaycard had offered to put Mr. F's account on a permanent hold, as this is not an option they typically offer. While Barclaycard had placed the account on hold for extended periods, the Ombudsman found that they were entitled to take action and transfer the account to a third-party company for collection as per the credit card's terms and conditions."

She contacted Barclays, but they refused to refund the payments as they believed she had made them herself or allowed someone else to do so. Miss G brought her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that it was more likely that Miss G had authorised the payments herself. The Ombudsman noted that the payments were made over a number of days, money was left in Miss G's account, and she did not report the unauthorised activity to Barclays until after she had made further payments from her account. The Ombudsman also found that Miss G was able to access cash from the fraudulent refunds that had been paid into her account. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold Miss G's complaint."
DRN-3818722,Miss A,Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard,Financial services,Barclaycard's handling of her request for help to recover money following a payment she made to stay at a holiday home.,Credit card,"Chargeback, Refund, Holiday booking","Consumer rights, Financial services, Travel",1789.2,October 2021,uphold,Kevin Parmenter,26 April 2023,Miss A is unhappy with how Barclays Bank UK PLC trading as Barclaycard handled her request for help to recover money following a payment she made to stay at a holiday home.,"Barclaycard declined to raise a chargeback claim on Miss A's behalf, despite the fact that she had a good chance of success.","Miss A wanted Barclaycard to refund the full amount of £1,789.20 that she had paid for the holiday home booking.","Miss A booked a holiday home through a booking agent, V, and paid the full amount of £1,789.20 using her Barclaycard. A week before the trip, a member of Miss A's family caught Covid-19 and she contacted the holiday home owner, D, to enquire about cancelling or changing the dates of the trip. D did not respond to her messages and the day before the trip was scheduled, Miss A messaged him again to say that the other members of the travelling party would be making use of the booking as intended. D replied to say that he had cancelled the booking as she had requested. Miss A contacted Barclaycard and asked them to help her get her money back, but they declined to raise a chargeback claim.","The Ombudsman found that Barclaycard should have raised a chargeback claim on Miss A's behalf, as she had a good chance of success. The Ombudsman was not persuaded that Miss A had confirmed that she wanted to cancel the booking, and considered that D's interpretation of events had led to the holiday home not being available on the date it was booked for. The Ombudsman also found that Barclaycard had incorrectly denied Miss A the chance to receive a refund through the chargeback scheme."

The issue was related to the classification of transactions as commercial Mastercard payments and international transactions, resulting in additional charges. Despite repeated requests, Barclays failed to provide evidence to support their position. F changed merchant services provider in June 2022.","In the absence of the requested information from Barclays, the Ombudsman concluded that it was not fair to charge F the international transaction fees. Barclays failed to provide evidence of proper notification to F about the new charges and failed to provide evidence to support the classification of transactions as international. Therefore, the Ombudsman upheld the complaint and directed Barclays to refund the international charges levied from October 2021 until the account was closed, along with interest."
DRN-3838715,Mr N,Barclays Bank UK PLC  trading as Barclaycard,Financial services,Barclaycard's handling of his claim for a refund after a business failed to honour a date for the supply and fit of four windows to his property.,Barclaycard,"['Chargeback', 'Section 75', 'Consumer rights']","['Consumer protection', 'Contract law', 'Financial services']",1030.64,14 October 2021,Dont uphold,Peter Cook,30 March 2023,Barclaycard's decision not to refund a deposit paid for windows that were not fitted.,"The complainant believed that the merchant had breached the contract by moving the fit date of the windows to mid-December 2021, just four days before the original fit date of 18 October 2021.",A refund of the deposit paid for the windows.,"Mr N entered into a contract with a business (A) for the supply and fit of four windows to his property. He paid a deposit of £1,030.64 on his Barclaycard. The fit date was moved from 18 October 2021 to mid-December 2021, which Mr N considered a breach of contract. He asked for his deposit to be returned, but A did not refund him. Mr N contacted Barclaycard to request a refund, but Barclaycard declined, stating that it had considered the matter under the Visa chargeback scheme and section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and was satisfied that it was not liable.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and arguments presented by both Mr N and Barclaycard. He agreed with Barclaycard that there was no breach of contract by A, as the contract allowed for changes to the fit date with as much notice as possible. The Ombudsman also considered Mr N's arguments under various consumer protection legislation, but found that Barclaycard was not liable to Mr N under those provisions either. Therefore, the Ombudsman found that Barclaycard had acted fairly and reasonably in declining Mr N's claim for a refund."

Barclays insisted that the notice was dispatched and provided an audit report as evidence, which was shared with the Ombudsman in a redacted form.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that Mr. M, the representative of G, did not receive the account closure notice. However, they found that Barclays had followed the correct procedure and dispatched the notice on the specified date. The Ombudsman also considered an email from Mr. M's relationship director, which did not explicitly confirm that G's account would not be closed. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that Barclays acted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the account and dismissed the complaint. The Ombudsman also explained that they cannot address the complaint about Barclays' delayed response as it falls outside their jurisdiction."

The company claims that the notice was received late and that the relationship director had assured them that some accounts would not be closed. Barclays maintains that the notice was sent on the specified date and denies any such assurance from the relationship director.",The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by both parties and concluded that Barclays complied with the terms and conditions of the account by providing the required two months' notice.

The Ombudsman received the complaint after Barclays' final response.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by Barclays, including an audit report, and concluded that the notice to close the account was dispatched on the date stated by Barclays. While acknowledging that the complainant received the notice late, the Ombudsman found no basis to hold Barclays responsible for delays beyond their control. Regarding the alleged statement by the RD, the Ombudsman interpreted an email from the RD as not providing confirmation that T's account would not be closed. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint."

Although the notice was received late, the Ombudsman could not hold Barclays responsible for delays beyond their control. The Ombudsman also explained that the Financial Ombudsman Service cannot consider complaints about complaint handling, so the complaint about the delayed response could not be addressed."

They reported the scam to Barclays, but Barclays did not refund the money.

Barclays denies these claims and states that it took steps to protect his accounts.

The Ombudsman also noted that Mr. C did not provide specific details of unauthorized transactions or cooperate fully with the investigation.

Barclays sent him letters informing him that his mortgage would revert to a tracker rate and provided information on how to arrange a new deal. However, in a phone call in March 2021, a Barclays representative gave Mr. C incorrect information about the reason for the increase in his monthly payment. Mr. C continued to pay his old monthly amount, resulting in arrears on the mortgage. Despite his attempts to resolve the issue, he was unable to obtain a new interest rate deal due to the arrears.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that Barclays provided incorrect information in the March 2021 phone call, but emphasized that Mr. C had been previously informed in writing about the upcoming changes to his mortgage.

His credit limit was increased several times over the course of the agreement. Mr. D argued that Barclaycard acted irresponsibly by providing him with the credit card and when it increased his limit. He said if Barclaycard had done adequate checks on his situation it would have seen that he wouldnt be able to repay his balance in a reasonable length of time. Barclaycard disagreed and said that it did all the necessary checks before it lent to Mr. D and when it increased his credit limit.,"The Ombudsman found that Barclaycard did not make appropriate and proportionate checks to ensure Mr. D could repay the increased credit limit sustainably. The Ombudsman considered Mr. D's income, expenditure, and overdraft history, and concluded that he was unlikely to be able to make sustainable repayments on the additional borrowing."

Barclaycard defaulted his account and sold the debt to a third-party debt collection firm. Mr. T claims that he was not informed about the default and that Barclaycard had told him the default would be removed from his credit file, which he says did not happen. Barclaycard maintains that it sent the default notice and that it informed Mr. T that the default record would be closed by Barclaycard and taken over by the third-party debt collection firm.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Barclaycard did not act unreasonably in defaulting Mr. T's account and that it provided sufficient information about the consequences of missed payments. While there was a misunderstanding regarding the removal of the default record, the Ombudsman found that Barclaycard did not explicitly state that the default would be removed from Mr. T's credit file. The Ombudsman also noted that Mr. T's credit file now reflects the accurate status of his account, with the default record being updated to show that it has been passed to the third-party debt collection firm."

Mr H had a medium-low risk tolerance, and Barclays recommended that he transfer his personal pension into a SIPP, using a discretionary investment management service. Mr H signed the necessary forms and the transfer was completed in November 2016. 

Mr H later complained to Barclays that the risk profile of his investments had been too low, and that he had not been adequately informed about the risks involved. He also felt that Barclays had not provided him with clear information about the charges associated with the service. 

Barclays investigated the complaint and upheld its decision, stating that Mr H had been provided with sufficient information about the risks involved and that the investment strategy was appropriate for his risk tolerance. 

Mr H referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS).","The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by both parties and concluded that Barclays had not acted unreasonably in its dealings with Mr H. The Ombudsman noted that Mr H had been provided with sufficient information about the risks involved in the investment strategy and that he had been given the opportunity to change his risk profile if he wished. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had not obstructed Mr H from changing his investment strategy.

One of T's former students, Ms. C, made a booking for a course and paid a deposit using her Mastercard. Later, she raised a chargeback claim for the deposit, which was unsuccessful. Subsequently, Ms. C raised a second chargeback claim for the remaining balance paid for the course. Barclays notified T about the second chargeback and requested information to defend it, but T did not respond within the specified timeframe. As a result, Barclays debited the chargeback amount from T's account. T complained to Barclays, arguing that it did not receive the notification about the second chargeback and that Barclays should have defended the claim based on the information provided during the defense of the first chargeback.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Barclays had acted reasonably in notifying T about the chargeback and requesting information to defend it. Although T did not receive the notification, Barclays was not required to send it through registered delivery post as per the agreement between the parties. The Ombudsman also noted that Barclays had previously defended a chargeback claim raised by Ms. C and that the second chargeback claim was for a different amount and on a different date.

Barclays investigated but declined to refund her money, citing exceptions to the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code.","The Ombudsman finds that Ms. K did not have a reasonable basis to believe that she was transacting with legitimate parties for legitimate purposes, and therefore the exception to reimbursement under the CRM Code applies. While Barclays could have provided more effective warnings, the payments made by Ms. K were not exceptional and did not clearly stand out as a fraud risk. The Ombudsman also finds that Ms. K did not carry out sufficient checks to satisfy herself that the company was legitimate."

This resulted in overcharged interest, additional costs, and emotional distress for the complainants.","The Ombudsman acknowledged Barclays' acceptance of its mistakes and the inconvenience caused to the complainants. However, the requested compensation of £1,500 was deemed excessive based on the Financial Ombudsman Service's overall approach to compensation.

He complained that Barclays had mis-sold him the fund as it was too risky for him and that he had not been adequately advised about the risks involved.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays had not mis-sold the fund to Mr F. She considered that the amount invested was suitable given Mr F's financial circumstances at the time and that he had been made aware of the risks involved in the investment.

Barclays initially gave Mr B and Mrs C a temporary refund, but it was re-debited following their investigation as they believed Mrs C must have disclosed her PIN.","The Ombudsman found that Mrs C had likely kept a written record of her PIN in her handbag, which amounted to gross negligence and made her liable for the transactions. While Barclays could have stopped the transactions if Mrs C had cancelled her card promptly after discovering her handbag was stolen, the Ombudsman did not find Barclays liable as they processed the transactions using valid retailer codes and Mrs C's genuine card and PIN."

However, they determined that Barclays had taken reasonable steps to address the issue by manually applying the gambling block. Regarding the gambling transactions, the Ombudsman considered that while the transactions were unusual, there was no guarantee that a conversation with Barclays would have changed Mr. R's behavior at the time. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that it would not be reasonable to ask Barclays to refund the transactions."

Additionally, Barclays did not disclose a down-valuation of the property, which prevented Mr. K from negotiating a lower purchase price.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays was at fault for the late release of funds and the failure to disclose the down-valuation. However, the Ombudsman considered that it could not be conclusively determined that Mr. K would have been successful in negotiating a lower price even if he had received the valuation.

Mrs P deducted the minimum payment from the outstanding balance and made a manual payment of £15,954.53, intending to clear it in full. But Barclaycard didn't claim the direct debit of Mrs P's minimum payment so an outstanding balance remained. And that meant the whole balance due in the 9 August 2022 became subject to interest.",The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Barclaycard should have collected the direct debit on 5 September 2022. The Ombudsman also found that Barclaycard's failure to collect the direct debit was the cause of the interest being charged. The Ombudsman therefore upheld Mrs P's complaint and directed Barclaycard to refund the interest charged in September 2022 and pay her £100 for the distress and inconvenience caused.

Barclays investigated and found that Mr. C had made subsequent transactions on the card after the alleged closure, including a £4.10 travel transaction on 16th February. Barclays also provided evidence of multiple missed payment letters sent to Mr. C prior to February 2022.",The Ombudsman considered that Mr. C should have been aware of the £4.10 transaction on 16th February and that he could not have genuinely believed the account was closed. The Ombudsman also noted that Barclays had sent multiple missed payment letters to Mr. C before February 2022 and that any issues on his credit file could not be attributed solely to the disputed £9.45 transaction. The Ombudsman concluded that it was more likely than not that the mortgage rejection was not solely due to the disputed transaction and that Barclays had paid Mr. C £25 for customer service which was considered generous.

This delay caused financial losses and emotional distress for Mr. N, who passed away unexpectedly during the complaint process.","The Ombudsman acknowledged Barclays' mistake in requiring a fresh valuation but considered the compensation offered by Barclays, which covered the direct financial losses and provided additional compensation, to be fair and reasonable.

However, the machine malfunctioned, and she left the branch without receiving a receipt. Later, she realized she had made a mistake and informed the bank that the actual amount she intended to deposit was £2,500, not £1,500 as she had initially stated. Barclays credited £1,510 to her account, which was the amount found in the machine's purge bin. Miss L disputed this amount and filed a complaint.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence, including machine records, Barclays' investigation, and the complainant's statements. The Ombudsman noted that the complainant's initial statement to Barclays was inconsistent with her later claim of depositing £2,500. The machine records showed that £1,510 was found in the purge bin, and there was no evidence to support the complainant's claim that she handed over additional money to a clerk. The Ombudsman concluded that it was more likely that the complainant deposited £1,500 and that Barclays' compensation for the delay in crediting the account was fair."

The mortgage offer issued in July 2008 set out the interest rate for the MCA as the Standard Variable Rate (SVR), which was 7.14% at the time. Mr and Mrs M argue that the interest rate on the MCA should have tracked the BoEBR, which would have resulted in a lower interest rate. Barclays argues that the MCA was not a tracker mortgage and that it was entitled to vary the SVR in accordance with the terms and conditions of the mortgage.","The Ombudsman found that the mortgage offer was clear that the MCA interest rate would be charged at the SVR and not at a rate that tracked the BoEBR. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had provided evidence to show that its funding costs increased during the period when the SVR was increased, and that the changes to the SVR were therefore fair and reasonable. The Ombudsman concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that Barclays had acted unfairly in varying the SVR."

However, the Ombudsman found that Barclays could have done more to prevent the scam by providing adequate warnings and intervening earlier. Despite this, the Ombudsman concluded that even if Barclays had done more, it is unlikely that Mr. H would have disclosed the scam or changed his mind about the investment.

She claimed that she didn't make these transactions and that her card had been stolen. Barclays investigated and concluded that Ms S was liable for the transactions as she had either authorised them or had been grossly negligent in keeping her PIN secure. Ms S disagreed and referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it was more likely than not that Ms S had either carried out the transactions herself, or had allowed someone else to do so by making her card and PIN available to them, or had been grossly negligent by writing down her PIN and keeping it with her card. In any of these scenarios, Ms S would be liable for the transactions and Barclays would not be required to refund her."

Barclays later admitted that the information provided in their final response letter was incorrect.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that Barclays has the right to take actions to protect its customers' accounts from fraud.

They received unclear reminders about the end of the fixed interest rate period on their home mortgage, which resulted in them missing the opportunity to secure a better rate. They also faced difficulties in applying for a new fixed rate deal, experiencing delays and overpayments.","The Ombudsman found that while Barclays' reminders could have been more specific, it was not unreasonable for them not to include additional details. However, the Ombudsman considered the distress and inconvenience faced by Mr and Mrs B due to the delay in applying the new mortgage rate and awarded them £250 in compensation. The Ombudsman also required Barclays to pay 8% simple interest on the overpayments made in August and September 2022."

Barclays replaced the Additions account with a fee-free current account that included a Tech pack. Mr and Mrs P did not opt out of the change and they were charged fees for the Tech pack.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays did not do anything wrong in selling the Additions account to Mr and Mrs P as it could have been useful to them. It was up to Mr and Mrs P to change the account if it no longer was useful to them, once the benefits and their overdraft usage changed. In relation to the Tech pack, the Ombudsman found that Barclays did enough to highlight that Mr and Mrs P's account was changing and that they could opt out of having the pack.

Therefore, Barclays is not responsible for the transfer not happening before the delisting.

In July 2022, Mr G raised a complaint with Barclays, stating that the loan had been provided irresponsibly and that he could not afford it. Barclays responded that they had undertaken checks into his financial position and were satisfied that he could afford the loan. Mr G remained dissatisfied and referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays had not accurately assessed Mr G's income and expenditure, and that they had increased his level of debt to an unsustainable level.

Despite clear signs of financial vulnerability, Barclays failed to take action to support him. Mr. C accumulated over £106,000 in debt, primarily through spread-betting high-risk portfolios using credit facilities provided by Barclays.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays missed clear signs of Mr. C's over-reliance on credit and failed to investigate the reasons behind his spending patterns. Barclays should have recognized Mr. C's vulnerability and offered appropriate support, such as reducing credit limits or providing financial advice. While the Ombudsman acknowledged that Mr. C's spending behavior contributed to his financial difficulties, Barclays' failure to intervene and offer support was a significant factor in the escalation of his debt."

They also felt that Barclays had discriminated against Mr. C because of his ill health and receipt of benefits.,They wanted Barclays to agree to a new fixed interest rate and extend the term of their mortgage.,"Mr. C and Ms. S had an interest-only mortgage with Barclays that was due to end in 2023. They applied for a new five-year fixed interest rate of 3.84%, but Barclays declined the application because the fixed rate would extend beyond the end of the mortgage term. They also applied for a term extension, but Barclays declined that application as well.",The Ombudsman found that Barclays had not acted unfairly in declining the application for a new interest rate and a mortgage term extension. The Ombudsman noted that Mr. C and Ms. S had agreed to repay the capital at the end of the agreed term and that they had the resources to do so. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had given fair consideration to the application for a term extension and that it was not unreasonable for Barclays to be concerned about the impact of Mr. C's reduced income on their ability to manage the mortgage payments over an extended term.

Mr. T alleges that the mortgage was mis-sold as it had no realistic way of repaying the balance at the end of the term. He also complains about Barclays' handling of the situation after the mortgage term ended and the subsequent legal action taken by Barclays to recover the outstanding mortgage balance.,"Mr. T's primary reason for complaining is that he believes the interest-only mortgage was unsuitable and mis-sold to him, leaving him with no feasible means of repaying the mortgage balance at the end of the term. He also expresses dissatisfaction with Barclays' handling of the matter, particularly the lack of communication and support provided after the mortgage term ended.","Mr. T seeks acknowledgment that the mortgage was mis-sold, an apology from Barclays for the distress caused, and a resolution to the ongoing legal action taken by Barclays to recover the mortgage balance.","Mr. T took out an interest-only mortgage with Barclays in 2009, which was set to mature in early 2021. However, Mr. T claims that the mortgage was mis-sold as it lacked a realistic repayment plan for the outstanding balance at the end of the term. Despite his concerns, Barclays initiated legal action to recover the unpaid mortgage balance. Mr. T's daughter brought the complaint on his behalf, expressing grievances about the mis-selling of the mortgage and Barclays' subsequent handling of the situation.","The Ombudsman acknowledges that the complaint about the mis-selling of the mortgage was filed beyond the permissible time limit set by the Financial Ombudsman Service's rules. Therefore, this aspect of the complaint is dismissed as time-barred. Regarding Mr. T's concerns about Barclays' handling of the matter after the mortgage term ended, the Ombudsman finds that Mr. T did not engage sufficiently with Barclays to discuss repayment options or present any concrete proposals for resolving the situation. The Ombudsman concludes that Barclays is entitled to take legal action to recover the outstanding mortgage balance given the lack of engagement and cooperation from Mr. T."

Mr. and Mrs. B claim that they were told by Barclays in 2016 that they could keep making their payments on the 1st of each month and they wouldn't be impacted, but Barclays denies this.","The Ombudsman found that Mr. and Mrs. B did miss a payment in April 2016, which caused the arrears balance. Barclays is entitled to seek payment of arrears, but it should ensure that any repayments are affordable for the customer. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays is not required to notify customers when it changes its internal systems, but it should ensure that any shortfall payments are payable in a way that is affordable for the customer. The Ombudsman upheld the complaint and directed Barclays to pay Mr. and Mrs. B £200 compensation as offered."

The transfer was eventually completed on 7th June after multiple attempts and caused inconvenience and distress to Mr. O. Barclays acknowledged the mistake and paid £200 as an apology for the poor service.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and agreed that Barclays was responsible for the delay in Transfer One. Although Barclays paid compensation for the inconvenience, the issue of Mr. O's loss of interest remained. The Ombudsman acknowledged that Mr. O intended to move the funds to an account with a higher interest rate (4.1%) but due to the delay, the funds were paid into an account with a lower interest rate (3.4%). The Ombudsman calculated the additional interest Mr. O would have earned and determined that Barclays should pay £85.18 to put him in the position he would have been in if not for their mistakes."

Despite Barclays' partial compensation, Mr E remained dissatisfied with the service and brought his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman acknowledged Barclays' right to implement security measures to prevent fraud but found that the bank provided poor customer service by giving incorrect information, experiencing issues with arranging a video call, and making factual errors in the final response letter.

Mr A, the rightful executor, complained that Barclays had acted without proper authority and requested the full amount in the accounts. Barclays offered to pay the residual amounts remaining in the accounts after the funeral invoice was paid, as well as the amount withdrawn by the unauthorised third party.","The Ombudsman considered that Barclays had sufficient documentation to pay the funeral invoice based on the information provided by Mr A's niece. While the bank could have requested a grant of probate due to the dispute over who was entitled to the proceeds, it was not unreasonable to rely on the documentation provided. The Ombudsman also noted that Mr A could seek to recover the money taken by his niece through legal channels. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that Barclays' offer to pay the residual amounts remaining in the accounts, less the amount paid to the funeral director, was fair and reasonable."
