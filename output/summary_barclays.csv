Mr. L, acting on behalf of T, attempted to appeal the decision but was given an incorrect email address. He also complained about the poor handling of his complaint by Barclays.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays had not acted unreasonably in declining the credit card application, as the decision was based on information from credit reference agencies. However, the Ombudsman upheld the complaint due to Barclays' poor handling of the complaint, including the provision of incorrect information and the failure to properly log Mr. L's complaint."

He later made a claim to Barclaycard under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, alleging that the Supplier had made misrepresentations and that there was an unfair debtor-creditor relationship. Barclaycard did not respond to the claim, so Mr M referred a complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that there was no debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in place between Mr M and Barclaycard, as the Supplier was not paid directly using the credit card. Therefore, the Consumer Credit Act did not apply to the claims made by Mr M.

The £100 offered by Barclays was deemed fair and reasonable compensation for the distress and inconvenience caused to Mrs. D.

She retired in September 2012 and in 2013, she took her tax-free cash from her stakeholder plan and purchased an annuity. In 2019, she met a friend who informed her that she may have been better off by buying added years in the TPS or contributing to the TPS Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC) scheme instead. She complained to Barclays, which rejected her complaint. She then referred her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays failed to provide suitable advice to Mrs A as it did not inform her of the in-house pension options available to her through the TPS. The Ombudsman considered that if Mrs A had been given suitable advice, she would have likely contributed to her employer's AVC scheme rather than the stakeholder pension plan. Therefore, the Ombudsman upheld the complaint and required Barclays to undertake a redress calculation in accordance with the regulator's FSAVC review guidance."

The complainant denied receiving any letters and argued that Barclays should have used alternative communication methods. Barclays maintained that they followed their process and were not responsible for delivery issues.,"The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it was likely that Barclays sent the letters as they were correctly addressed. Given the bank's legal obligations and the scale of the contact operation, it was not unreasonable for Barclays to rely on postal communication. The Ombudsman found no evidence of wrongdoing by Barclays and therefore did not uphold the complaint."

He also found that, even if there had been a misrepresentation, Barclaycard would not be liable under section 75 because there was no debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in place. The Ombudsman considered that Barclaycard's £25 compensation to Mr S was fair and reasonable for the poor handling of his claim and that its response to his section 75 claim was fair and reasonable."

Despite Mr. K's claims of contacting Barclays multiple times, the restriction was only lifted in March 2022 after he complained. Barclays acknowledged some shortcomings in communication and provided a £125 inconvenience payment and refunded fees.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays acted reasonably in restricting the account due to incomplete documentation. While Barclays should have followed up on Mr. K's December 2021 call, the Ombudsman considered the £125 payment and fee refund to be fair compensation.

However, P was actually a scam company and Mr C lost all of his money. He complained to Barclays, who initially refunded the money but then reversed the refund. Mr C complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays was not liable for Mr C's losses because he had authorised the payments to P.

Mr and Mrs B rejected the offer and continued their complaint.,"The Ombudsman considered whether Barclays had made reasonable adjustments for Mr and Mrs B's circumstances and whether they had discussed options for repayment before appointing receivers. The Ombudsman found that Barclays had not made any specific reasonable adjustments, but that they had taken Mr and Mrs B's circumstances into account when making decisions. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had given Mr and Mrs B a long time to propose a suitable way forward and that they had eventually started the process of recovering the debt by appointing receivers as they had no other viable options available."

Ms D disputes that the PPI compensation was applied correctly and claims she continued to make payments on the loan until 2021 despite the account being closed in 2018.",The Ombudsman reviewed the loan account transactions and found that Barclays did apply the PPI compensation to Ms D's loan balance as stated.

Barclays initially informed her that the payment had gone through, but it was later revealed that the payment was cancelled due to fraud detection. Miss D had to make the payment again using a third-party provider, resulting in a different exchange rate.","The Ombudsman agreed that Barclays should have tried to contact Miss D again after the payment was cancelled and that they failed to communicate clearly with her on several occasions.

He invested over £27,000 and was unable to withdraw his investment. He asked Barclays to refund the money under the CRM Code, but Barclays refused, considering it a civil buyer/seller dispute. The investigator upheld the complaint, but Barclays failed to respond, leading to the escalation to the Ombudsman.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's conclusion that the investment opportunity was a scam and not a civil dispute. Barclays failed to provide evidence of an effective warning or establish that Mr A did not have a reasonable basis for believing the payments were legitimate.

H complained that the notice was received late and that his relationship director had told him some accounts would not be closed. Barclays upheld the closure decision but later apologised for the delayed response.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays had complied with the account closure terms by providing the required two months' notice. Although the notice was received late, the Ombudsman could not hold Barclays responsible for delays beyond their control.

Barclays initially reimbursed the funds but later reversed the reimbursement after a chargeback was unsuccessful. Ms. J complained about this.,The Ombudsman considered whether Barclays should have done more to protect Ms. J from the scam and whether it should have made additional checks on the disputed payments. The Ombudsman concluded that Barclays did not act in error by not intervening and that it could not reasonably have done more to recover the funds. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays was not wrong to re-debit the funds after the chargeback failed.

Barclays acknowledged a system error but failed to rectify it promptly, causing distress and financial implications for Mr and Mrs W.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays' system error had a significant impact on Mr and Mrs W's credit files and caused ongoing inconvenience. The Ombudsman also considered that Barclays did not provide sufficient justification for splitting the lump sum payment between the mortgage and MCA accounts against Mr and Mrs W's preference. Therefore, the Ombudsman upheld the complaint and directed Barclays to make necessary adjustments, consolidate arrears, and provide compensation for the distress caused."

Barclays declined the request due to a signature mismatch. Mr M passed away before the issue was resolved. Barclays offered £150 in compensation, which the complainant's estate appealed.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays Bank UK PLC was not unreasonable in declining the transfer request as it was unable to verify Mr M's signature.

He made multiple complaints about the issue and the poor customer service he received. Barclays acknowledged the problems but offered only £100 in compensation, which Mr. H considered insufficient.","The Ombudsman agreed that Barclays was at fault for the payment issue and poor customer service. While acknowledging Mr. H's request for £200 compensation, the Ombudsman determined that the impact of the inconvenience did not warrant such an amount. Therefore, an additional £100 compensation was deemed fair."

So a double payment was made. Barclaycard refunded one amount of £456.72 to the current account on 21 July 2022.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that there was no evidence that an amount of £1,000 had been taken from Mr H's accounts. The Ombudsman also considered whether the double payment of £456.72 caused the confusion, but concluded that this was not the case. However, the Ombudsman did agree that there had been some poor service by Barclaycard - as some calls had been cut off. For that, he said Barclaycard should pay compensation of £50."

Despite realizing the scam, he was unable to recover the funds. He filed a complaint with Barclays for a chargeback, but it was denied.","The Ombudsman determined that Barclays was not responsible for Mr. F's loss because the payments were made to a legitimate business and did not trigger the bank's fraud prevention systems. While one payment was larger, it was not significantly high enough to warrant Barclays to stop it. Therefore, Barclays did not miss an opportunity to prevent the scam."

One of T's former students, Ms. C, made payments for a course using her Mastercard. She later raised chargeback claims for both the deposit and the remaining balance. Barclays notified T about the first chargeback claim, which T responded to. However, T did not receive the notification about the second chargeback claim within the timeframe specified by Barclays and failed to provide the requested information. As a result, Barclays was unable to defend the second chargeback, and the amount was debited from T's account.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that T did not receive the letter from Barclays informing them about the second chargeback claim. However, under the terms of the agreement, Barclays was not required to send the letter via registered delivery, and it was T's responsibility to ensure that they received the communication. The Ombudsman also considered that Barclays had acted reasonably in requesting evidence to defend the chargeback and that T's failure to provide the information within the specified timeframe resulted in their inability to defend the claim.

Barclays argued that Mr C had complained too late about the sale of his packaged accounts and that the add-on packs were not mis-sold. The ombudsman found that the Additions account was likely mis-sold but that the add-on packs were not.,"The ombudsman found that Mr C was likely misled into thinking that upgrading to the Additions account would help his mortgage application be approved. However, the ombudsman did not find that the add-on packs were mis-sold as the letters sent to Mr C made it clear that they would be added to his account to provide similar levels of cover that he used to receive under the Premier Life account and that they were optional products that he could opt out of."

Despite numerous attempts to contact Barclays and provide necessary information, the process was plagued by issues such as incorrect account details, address mismatches, and failure to send or process documents. As a result, they were charged an incorrect interest rate and incurred additional costs.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the delays and mistakes made by Barclays but considered the compensation offered by the bank to be fair and reasonable. While expressing understanding for the complainants' frustration, the Ombudsman explained that the requested level of compensation was not in line with the service's overall approach to compensation."

In 2013, he defaulted on the account and began making payments of £1 per month. In 2017, Barclaycard sold Mr P's debt to a third-party firm. Mr P complained to Barclaycard, arguing that it should have written off his debt instead of selling it. Barclaycard responded that it was legally entitled to sell the debt and that Mr P was bound by the terms and conditions of his credit agreement. Mr P referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.",The Ombudsman found that Barclaycard did not breach the Standards for Lending Practice when it sold Mr P's debt to a third-party firm. The Ombudsman noted that Barclaycard gave Mr P reasonable notice of the transfer and that there was no evidence that Barclaycard was aware of Mr P's mental health issues at the time of the transfer.

They complained that Barclays increased their monthly mortgage payments without explanation. Barclays explained that the payments were correct based on the way the accounts are intended to work and the information provided to Mr and Mrs L. The Ombudsman agreed with Barclays' explanation and found that the payments were correct.,The Ombudsman considered the information provided by both parties and found that the payments taken by Barclays were consistent with the way the accounts are intended to work and with the information provided to Mr and Mrs L. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays provided sufficient explanation for the increased payments.

Unauthorised transactions totalling £3,940 were made using her debit card a few hours later. Barclays initially gave Mr B and Mrs C a temporary refund, but it was re-debited following their investigation as they believed Mrs C had been negligent in keeping her PIN secure.","The Ombudsman found that Mrs C had likely kept a written record of her PIN in her handbag along with her card, which amounted to gross negligence. Although Barclays had initially refunded the unauthorised transactions, they were entitled to hold Mrs C liable for the loss as she had failed to keep her payment tools safe. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays did not have to do more to flag the disputed transactions as fraudulent as they were not out of the ordinary spending pattern on the account and were made using Mrs C's genuine card and PIN."

She sought assistance from a staff member who was engaged with another customer. Ms. M alleges that the staff member was rude and unhelpful, leading to a verbal and physical altercation with the other customer. Despite the escalation, the staff member did not intervene and seemed to side with the other customers. Another staff member eventually helped Ms. M with her transaction.","The Ombudsman acknowledges the distressing experience of Ms. M but emphasizes that the investigation can only assess the actions of Barclays, not the other customer. Due to the lack of conclusive evidence, including unavailable CCTV footage, the Ombudsman cannot determine the exact sequence of events. While Barclays apologized and provided feedback to the branch manager, the Ombudsman finds their response reasonable under the circumstances. The absence of an obligation for the branch to call the police and the intervention of another staff member to complete the transaction are also considered. The Ombudsman concludes that there is insufficient evidence to suggest unfair or unreasonable behavior by Barclays."

Barclays acknowledged the error and offered £200 in compensation, but Miss G felt this was insufficient. The Ombudsman agreed that £400 was a more appropriate amount of compensation, but could not order Barclays to change its policies to prevent the issue from happening to others.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays was at fault for sending the statements to the wrong address and that the £200 offered in compensation was not sufficient. However, the Ombudsman could not order Barclays to change its policies as this was outside of their jurisdiction."

After the minimum payment was missed for four months, the card was canceled and a default notice was sent. Miss P paid off the arrears in full and made an arrangement to pay £79 per month. She complained that Barclays did not treat her fairly or compassionately and that she was not given a decent grace period.",The Ombudsman found that Barclays had acted within the terms and conditions of the credit card agreement and that it was reasonable for Barclays to issue a default notice after four missed payments. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had tried to assist Miss P and had not put any pressure on her to make payments she could not afford.

Mr P claims that their account should have been credited with the respective shares and warrants shortly after, but it wasn't. Despite contacting Barclays multiple times, the issue remained unresolved, and the value of the shares and warrants decreased significantly.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the inconvenience and distress caused to Mr and Mrs P due to the delay in crediting their shares and warrants. However, the Ombudsman found that Barclays was not solely responsible for the delay, as it was likely caused by issues with third-party businesses and registrars. While Barclays could have done more to manage expectations and communicate better, the £350 compensation offered by Barclays was deemed fair and reasonable under the circumstances."

While the complainant had concerns about privacy, the information was necessary for Barclays to assess her financial situation and set up the paydown plan. The Ombudsman also noted that Barclays later relaxed its requirements and was able to agree on a paydown plan without the need for the form."

However, in 2022, Barclays contacted him and said he needed to repay the reserve balance of around £22,000. Mr. C complained that this was a mistake as he never intended to repay the mortgage and wanted to keep it to continue using the reserve facility.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays did not act fairly or reasonably in 2022 when it told Mr. C he must repay the mortgage, including the reserve. The Ombudsman considered that it would be fair for Barclays to reinstate the mortgage and the reserve on the same terms with an end date of 16 March 2029. The Ombudsman also found that Barclays had not treated Mr. C fairly and awarded him £600 for distress and inconvenience."

Barclays failed to release the mortgage funds on time, resulting in late completion penalties for Mr. K. Additionally, Barclays did not disclose a down-valuation of the property, which Mr. K believes affected his ability to negotiate a lower purchase price.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays was at fault for failing to release the mortgage funds on time and for not disclosing the down-valuation. However, the Ombudsman did not find that Mr. K was entitled to the full amount of compensation he was seeking, as it could not be definitively proven that he would have been successful in negotiating a lower purchase price."

She also believed that Barclays should have considered her active relationship with the bank through another account and the Dormant Bank and Building Society Accounts Act 2008.,"Miss M wanted Barclays to reactivate her account, compensate her for the inconvenience faced, and review their policies and procedures to ensure better customer service.","Barclays restricted access to Miss M's foreign currency account due to inactivity, considering it dormant. Miss M argued that she had attempted to withdraw funds in March 2022 but was misinformed by a Barclays staff member, leading to an unnecessary visit to the branch. She also raised concerns about the time taken to regain access to her funds and the impact on the exchange rate.","The Ombudsman found that while Barclays acted within their rights and industry practices in making the account dormant, there were some shortcomings in customer service. The Ombudsman acknowledged the inconvenience caused to Miss M due to the misleading information provided by the staff member and awarded her an additional £50 compensation for the unnecessary branch visit. However, the Ombudsman upheld Barclays' decision to make the account dormant as there was no transaction made to prevent the dormancy process."

She made these payments from an account she held with a different banking provider to an account held with Barclays. Miss M complained to her bank and raised concerns about Barclays via the Financial Ombudsman Service. Barclays investigated and concluded that it was a buyer-seller dispute and that it was not liable for any loss Miss M incurred.","The Ombudsman considered the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code, which Barclays is a signatory of, and determined that it does not apply in the circumstances of the payments Miss M made. The Ombudsman concluded that the payments were not made as a result of a scam or fraud and that RB was likely a firm that encountered financial difficulty rather than a fraudulent business. Therefore, the Ombudsman could not safely conclude that Miss M was the victim of a scam and could not apply the CRM Code to ask Barclays to refund Miss M."

He followed the link in the email and signed up for the loan, believing it to be a top-up. However, he later realized that it was a new loan with different terms and higher monthly payments.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that the information provided in the welcome letter for the new loan was clear and sufficient to indicate that it was a new loan, not a top-up. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not find Barclays to be at fault and did not uphold the complaint."

Barclays maintained that it was Mr M's responsibility to cancel the policy and that he was aware of the overdraft and charges as he frequently logged into his online banking.","The Ombudsman agreed with Barclays that it was not their responsibility to unilaterally cancel the insurance policy and that Mr M should have taken action if he could not afford the payments. The Ombudsman also found that Mr M was aware of the overdraft and charges as he logged into his account regularly.

However, he claims that Barclaycard's final response letter regarding the chargebacks contained unclear and misleading information, leading to confusion about the actual amount refunded. This confusion allegedly affected his ability to challenge the merchant and potentially pursue a Section 75 claim. Mr. T also disputes the default of his account, stating that he requested repayment plans or a payment holiday during the COVID pandemic but was denied.","The Ombudsman acknowledges that Barclaycard's final response letter could have been clearer but concludes that the unclear information did not significantly impact Mr. T's ability to defend his chargeback claims or pursue a Section 75 claim.

Barclays also provided evidence of multiple missed payment letters sent to Mr. C prior to February 2022.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Mr. C should have known that the account was not closed as there was another transaction after the disputed one. The Ombudsman also noted that Barclays had sent multiple missed payment letters to Mr. C in the past, indicating a history of payment problems. The Ombudsman concluded that it was unlikely that the declined mortgage application was solely due to the disputed transaction and that Barclays had already paid Mr. C £25 for customer service which was considered generous."

Mrs. K believes that the search was not sufficient, and she referred the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and concluded that Barclays is not currently holding on to Mrs. K's funds. The last firm record of the money being held is a freezing order from May 1989. Barclays has not been able to provide any further statements for this account, and the Ombudsman finds this reasonable considering the passage of time. The Ombudsman also considered Mrs. K's historical statements, but they do not suggest that Barclays is still holding on to the funds. The Ombudsman is satisfied that Barclays has carried out sufficient searches for any other accounts held by Mrs. K, and there are no records for her account on the dormancy register.

In August 2022, he applied for a new rate but was informed that he needed to go through a transfer of equity (TOE) application and an affordability assessment, and that he would have to pay the ERC if he wanted to switch before the existing deal ended. He complained to Barclays and the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Barclays should have explained to Mr. M that a TOE was required before he could complete a rate switch application and that he would have to pay the ERC if he switched before the existing deal ended. However, the Ombudsman also found that Barclays did not guarantee that the August 2022 application would be successful and that it was reasonable for them to check Mr. M's entitlement to his late partner's share of the property and his ability to afford the mortgage on his own. Therefore, the Ombudsman concluded that it would not be fair to require Barclays to honour the rate Mr. M applied for in August 2022."

Barclays claimed that the decision to close the accounts was made after an internal review and that they were unable to provide a specific explanation due to legal and regulatory obligations. The complainant disputed this, stating that he had not breached any rules or terms of the accounts.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that banks are subject to legal and regulatory obligations and that Barclays had acted within its rights to restrict and close the complainant's accounts.

He reported the incident to Barclays in 2022, but they declined to issue a refund as 'O' was regulated during the investment period.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and concluded that, while there were warnings about 'O' published in 2013, they did not indicate that the company was operating as a scam. At the time of Mr. K's payments, 'O' was regulated by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) with passporting rights through the FCA, allowing them to offer services to UK customers. The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's assessment that even if Barclays had intervened, it would not have reasonably suspected a fraud or scam based on the information available at the time.

The Ombudsman found that it was more likely that the builder was attempting to operate as a legitimate business at the time and that other factors ultimately meant the building work wasn't completed.
