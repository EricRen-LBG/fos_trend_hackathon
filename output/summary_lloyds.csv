As a result, the complainant made payments totalling £250,000 to two accounts held with Lloyds Bank PLC. Lloyds Bank PLC blocked the accounts after some of the payments were made, but the complainant still lost around £65,000. The complainant believed that Lloyds Bank PLC should have done more to prevent the fraud and that they were not adequately compensated for the losses incurred.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank PLC could have done more to prevent the fraud and that they were therefore liable for some of the losses incurred by the complainant. However, the Ombudsman also found that the complainant was partly responsible for the losses due to their failure to take reasonable steps to protect themselves from fraud. The Ombudsman therefore directed Lloyds Bank PLC to pay the complainant £134,825.17 in compensation, plus interest."

He contacted Lloyds to dispute the payments, but they declined to pursue the matter to arbitration, the final stage of the chargeback dispute process.","The Ombudsman found that the payments were authorised by the complainant and that Lloyds was not liable for the loss. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds was not required to stop the payments after they were notified about the scam, as the payments had already been processed."

He was dissatisfied with the bed as the wheeled drawers got stuck on the carpet. He also had issues with the warranty as he was initially told it was for 15 years but later found out it was only for 5 years. Mr. V tried to resolve the issues with the retailer but was unsuccessful. He then complained to Lloyds Bank about their handling of the chargeback, their response to his Subject Access Requests, and a third party's data being added to his file.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank had not acted unreasonably in handling the chargeback request as they had gathered the necessary information and attempted to raise the chargeback before the deadline. However, the Ombudsman considered that Lloyds Bank should have done more to assist Mr. V in obtaining the required information and should have provided a clearer explanation of the chargeback process and deadlines. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds Bank had failed to properly handle Mr. V's Subject Access Requests and had breached data protection laws by adding a third party's data to his file. However, the Ombudsman considered that the compensation offered by Lloyds Bank for these issues was fair and reasonable."

Mr. C raised a complaint due to the inconvenience caused and the potential impact on their business. Despite Lloyds Bank apologizing for the delay in responding and reconsidering their decision, Mr. C remained dissatisfied and referred the complaint to the ombudsman.","The ombudsman acknowledged that Lloyds Bank has legal and regulatory obligations to review accounts and may need to close them. The bank's decision to review the account was prompted by changes in regulations, and they were within their rights to do so. While Lloyds Bank initially stated that the account would be closed, they had not yet provided the required two months' notice and had placed the closure on hold while they reconsidered their approach. The ombudsman considered that the inconvenience caused to the complainant's business was not significant enough to warrant compensation and that an apology from Lloyds Bank was sufficient to put things right."
DRN-3838759,Mrs E,Lloyds Bank PLC,Banking,"Lloyds Bank contacting the police when she tried to withdraw £20,000 in cash from her account.",Cash withdrawal,"Banking Protocol, cash withdrawal, fraud","Banking security, customer privacy, police involvement",20000.0,12 May 2022,opposite,Sophie Wilkinson,1 March 2023,"The complainant was complaining about the actions of Lloyds Bank PLC when she went into branch to withdraw £20,000 in cash.","The complainant felt that Lloyds had attempted to bully, threaten and pressurise her by involving the police.",An apology from Lloyds and compensation for the distress caused.,"The complainant went into a branch of Lloyds to withdraw £20,000 in cash. She was taken to a side room and asked what she wanted the money for. She refused to tell Lloyds, and the branch manager contacted the police. The police officer agreed that the complainant was entitled to her privacy, and Lloyds allowed her to make the cash withdrawal. The complainant felt that Lloyds had breached her privacy and that she had been treated like a criminal.",The Ombudsman found that Lloyds had acted in line with its terms and conditions and with the Banking Protocol when it contacted the police. The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint.

After receiving some payments from these investments, the payments stopped, and both companies went into liquidation. Mr. H contacted Lloyds to explain he had been scammed, but Lloyds did not reimburse his lost funds.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and arguments and concluded that Mr. H authorized the payments in question and was tricked by a third party into instructing Lloyds to make the payments. Although Mr. H did not intend the money to go to scammers, he is presumed liable for his loss under the Payment Services Regulations and the terms and conditions of his account. The Ombudsman also considered that Lloyds should have been monitoring accounts and payments to counter various risks, including fraud and scams, but that such intervention would not have made a difference to Mr. H's decision to send the payments. The Ombudsman further considered that the investments may have been risky, but Lloyds was not obliged to provide investment advice or prevent Mr. H from getting involved in an investment opportunity that appeared legitimate. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds was not required to do more than give a generic warning about the risk of investing and that such a warning would not have changed Mr. H's decision to proceed with the transactions. The Ombudsman also considered that Lloyds did what was expected to recover the funds but that recovery was not a viable option due to the length of time that had passed. The Ombudsman concluded that it would not be fair and reasonable to hold Lloyds liable for Mr. and Mrs. H's loss."

He was also unhappy about a charge that was registered against his property and the bank's advertising practices. Mr J complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, arguing that Lloyds Bank PLC had not treated him fairly.",The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank PLC was within its rights to close Mr J's accounts without giving a reason. The Ombudsman also found that the charge against Mr J's property was correctly applied and that the bank's advertising practices were not misleading. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC had not treated Mr J unfairly and therefore did not uphold the complaint.

Despite repeated attempts, his payments were declined, and he incurred additional costs due to the delays. Lloyds acknowledged some issues but offered insufficient compensation.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds could have advised Mr. F to use the existing payee option for the second payment, which would have likely avoided the issues. Additionally, system issues and inadequate handling by call handlers contributed to the inconvenience faced by Mr. F. Therefore, the Ombudsman recommended additional compensation for distress and inconvenience."

They subsequently took out several further advances and were sold PPI policies in 2002 and 2009. In 2015, Lloyds upheld their mis-sale complaint in relation to the 2009 policy and cancelled it, but the 2002 policy remained in place. Mr and Mrs B continued to dispute the mis-sale of the 2002 policy and also requested its cancellation in 2020, but the policy continued until the mortgage was redeemed in 2021.","The Ombudsman found that the PPI policy was not mis-sold as Mr and Mrs B had a genuine need for the cover and could have benefitted from it. However, the Ombudsman found that Lloyds should have cancelled the policy when requested in 2020 and therefore upheld the complaint in part. Lloyds was ordered to refund all premiums paid after 28 February 2020, when Mr and Mrs B first requested the policy to be cancelled."

However, it turned out to be a scam, and the money was transferred to a different account. Lloyds refused to refund the loss, stating that B had not been sufficiently cautious when making the payment.","The Ombudsman considered the circumstances of the case and determined that B did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the payment was legitimate. The price of the vehicle was very low compared to the market value, and there were other factors that should have raised concerns about the legitimacy of the seller. B had not carried out any checks on the vehicle or the seller before making the payment. Therefore, Lloyds was not liable to refund the loss under the CRM Code."

She reported the scam to Lloyds in 2016, but Lloyds did not take any action. In 2017, Mrs S fell victim to another similar scam and made further payments. Lloyds declined to reimburse her for her losses and her complaint was referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) in July 2019.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds should have done more to protect Mrs S from the scam and that it could have intervened on three of the payments she made in 2016. However, the Ombudsman also found that Mrs S should share some responsibility for the loss as she should have had serious concerns about the payments she was making by that time. The Ombudsman therefore upheld the complaint in part and directed Lloyds to refund 50% of the three payments Mrs S made from 1 February 2016 until 15 March 2016, plus additional interest and compensation."

The investments included a medium-risk UK Growth Fund, a low-risk Guaranteed Stock Market Bond, and an Open-ended Investment Company (OEIC) investment. Mr. L complained that the advice was unsuitable, especially considering his circumstances following a recent bereavement. Lloyds upheld the complaint, stating that the investments were appropriate based on Mr. L's financial situation and risk tolerance. Mr. L brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence, including the point of sale paperwork and the fact find, and concluded that the investment recommendations were suitable for Mr. L. The Ombudsman noted that Mr. L had the capacity to absorb investment loss and was in a strong enough financial situation to invest £70,000. While acknowledging Mr. L's difficult personal circumstances, the Ombudsman did not find that they affected his ability to make financial decisions or that Lloyds acted unfairly in providing investment advice. The Ombudsman also considered the level of risk involved in the investments and found that a medium-risk investment could be suitable for an inexperienced investor, as it provided the opportunity for capital growth while still managing risk. Overall, the Ombudsman concluded that the investments reasonably reflected Mr. L's risk approach and investment objectives."

After a review, Lloyds closed C's bank account but kept the CBIL in place, opening a loan servicing account (LSA) for loan repayments. Repayments were initially scheduled for December 2020 but were later deferred to June 2021. C missed several repayments, leading to the loan account being passed to the bank's recoveries team. C complained about not receiving clear information on repayment details and disputed the default.","The Ombudsman concluded that C was aware of the repayment schedule and the LSA account details. C's failure to fund the LSA resulted in missed repayments. Lloyds' communication about the missed payments and the default was deemed sufficient. Therefore, the Ombudsman found no unfairness or unreasonableness in Lloyds' actions."

Upon arrival at the hotel, she was given the wrong type of room and was moved to a smaller room on the third day of her stay. She complained to the holiday company, which made her an offer as a gesture, but she declined it. She then complained to Lloyds, who declined her request for a refund, stating that she had not provided sufficient evidence within the time limits for a chargeback.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that Lloyds had not acted unfairly by declining Miss S's request for a refund. The Ombudsman noted that Miss S had accepted she made the transaction for the holiday with the holiday company in question and did not dispute the amount, date, or other aspects of the transaction itself. The Ombudsman also considered that Lloyds could not have challenged the transaction through a chargeback as Miss S had stayed at the hotel for the full period of the holiday and received the full benefit of it. Additionally, the Ombudsman considered that the issues Miss S raised with Lloyds' customer service did not impact her chances of winning a refund through the chargeback."

They alleged that Lloyds asked excessive questions during the mortgage review process and failed to honor an offer to fix the mortgage rate at £570 per month. Lloyds denied any wrongdoing, stating that the mortgage review was necessary and that no such offer was made.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds was entitled to carry out a mortgage review before recommending a new interest rate product and that the questions asked about the repayment vehicle were justified given the length of time left on the mortgage. The Ombudsman also found that there was no evidence to support Mr and Mrs O's claim that they were offered a rate that would have resulted in payments of £570 per month. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint."

In June 2021, Lloyds removed the fee-waiver from all Gold Service accounts, but due to an error, Mrs. B was not charged the monthly account fee until October 2022. Lloyds agreed to refund the account fees that had been charged and paid £115 in compensation, but Mrs. B continued to pay the monthly account fee while awaiting the outcome of her complaint.","The Ombudsman considered that Lloyds was entitled to remove the fee-waiver feature and that Mrs. B had been given reasonable notice of the change. However, the Ombudsman also considered that Lloyds should have sent a reminder to Mrs. B before the monthly account fee was charged in October 2022 and that the £115 compensation was reasonable for the distress and inconvenience caused. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds had done enough to put matters right and did not need to do anything more."

W did not deliver or install the windows and went into administration. Lloyds Bank PLC refused to refund Mrs K's money, stating that she was the victim of a civil dispute rather than an APP scam.","The Ombudsman found that there was not enough evidence to support Mrs K's claim that W was acting fraudulently when she made the payments. He also found that Lloyds Bank PLC was not liable for the loss suffered by Mrs K as she had chosen to pay by bank transfer, which offers less protection than paying by card."

He made five cash withdrawals over a period of two weeks, with the amounts ranging from £2,400 to £20,000. Mr K claims that Lloyds did not do enough to protect him from the scam, as they did not ask him enough questions about the withdrawals or take steps to verify the legitimacy of the transactions. Lloyds argues that they did all they could to protect Mr K and that he should have been more cautious about the scam.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds should have asked more questions about the withdrawals of £5,000 and £20,000, and that had they done so the scam would have been uncovered. However, the Ombudsman also found that Mr K could have done more to protect himself and should bear a share of the responsibility for the losses.

The Ombudsman considered that the delay was partly due to S not promptly responding to Lloyds' requests for information and that Lloyds was not entirely responsible for the missed funding opportunity. Therefore, the Ombudsman deemed the compensation paid by Lloyds to be fair and did not require any further action from the bank."

Mr O complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds should have intervened and made reasonable enquiries with Mr O when he made the £5,000 payment, as it was a large and unusual transaction. Lloyds' failure to do so contributed to Mr O's loss. Therefore, the Ombudsman upheld Mr O's complaint and directed Lloyds to refund the £5,000 payment, remove any interest and fees from the loan, and pay Mr O 8% simple interest per year on the loan repayments he made."

The merchant challenged the dispute and Lloyds told Mr H they had until 27 January 2023 to provide further evidence. Mr H says he didn't receive the email and Lloyds didn't action his request to resend it until 30 January 2023, by which time it was too late to provide further evidence.","The Ombudsman considered that even if Lloyds had received Mr H's evidence in time, his chargeback claim likely wouldn't have succeeded as the merchant had provided a defence to the claim and there was insufficient evidence to challenge it.

However, the Ombudsman did not find that the loss of the deeds was responsible for the loss of any sale or renting of the property, and therefore could not award compensation for financial loss. The Ombudsman did award Mr P £250 for trouble and upset."

She alleges that she was not adequately informed about the AVC options offered by her occupational pension scheme (OPS). Lloyds Bank PLC maintains that the advice provided was suitable and that Mrs. K was made aware of the FSAVC plan's benefits and potential charges.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and determined that Lloyds Bank PLC complied with regulatory obligations and provided sufficient information about the FSAVC plan. While the advisor was required to mention the generic benefits of in-house AVC options, the Ombudsman found that documentation signed by Mrs. K indicated her awareness of the AVCs offered by her OPS. The Ombudsman also noted that Lloyds Bank PLC was not required to provide a direct comparison between AVC and FSAVC options and that Mrs. K had a period of reflection and opportunity to make further inquiries before finalizing the FSAVC application."

He reported the scam to Lloyds but they were unable to recover the money. He complained about the lack of intervention and poor service.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds should have intervened as the payment was out of character, but that this would not have likely changed the outcome as Mr H had carried out thorough due diligence. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds had fulfilled its obligations in terms of KYC checks and attempted to recover the funds. Therefore, the complaint was not upheld."

During this time, the value of her ISA significantly decreased. Lloyds Bank upheld her complaint in part and paid her £50 for the inconvenience, but she was not satisfied and referred the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank should have done more to assist Mrs. W and that the £50 compensation paid was insufficient. While acknowledging that Lloyds Bank was entitled to update its online services, it should have ensured fair treatment of customers. The Ombudsman noted that Mrs. W could have obtained up-to-date fund price information online or by using the online chat service, but she was unable to access her online account due to the error message. Therefore, the Ombudsman upheld the complaint in part and recommended an additional £100 compensation to Mrs. W."

Despite multiple branch visits and long phone call waiting times, the issue was not resolved for a month. Mr. K claimed financial hardship as he couldn't be paid by his employer and had to borrow money. Lloyds offered compensation, but Mr. K considered it insufficient.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the inconvenience faced by Mr. K but found that Lloyds responded adequately by updating their records and providing a letter to support his employer verification. The Ombudsman considered the compensation offered by Lloyds to be fair and reasonable, taking into account the circumstances and the fact that the initial error was made by Mr. K when opening the account."

They claimed that they were mis-sold because they were led to believe they needed them to have the overdraft facility on their account. Lloyds initially said that the complaint was made too late, but the adjudicator decided that the complaint about the Platinum and Premier accounts could be considered. The adjudicator didn't think the accounts were mis-sold, but Mr and Mrs H disagreed and the matter was referred for an ombudsman's decision.","The ombudsman considered all the evidence and arguments and concluded that Mr H was given a fair choice in whether to upgrade his account, and that he upgraded (at least in part) to take advantage of the overdraft benefits of the packaged accounts. The ombudsman also considered whether the accounts were sold on an advised or non-advised basis and found that the Premier upgrade occurred on an advised basis, but that the recommendation was not unreasonable given Mr H's circumstances. The ombudsman also found that Mr H was made aware of the monthly fee for the accounts and the benefits included, and that he agreed to the accounts with a good appreciation of what they cost and what benefits they came with. The ombudsman acknowledged that Mr H may now feel that the accounts have been poor value for money, but that doesn't mean that Lloyds was acting incorrectly or unfairly by selling the accounts to him when it did."

He experienced several issues with the car, including a knocking noise from the engine. He filed a claim with Lloyds under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, but Lloyds denied the claim due to lack of evidence that the car was of unsatisfactory quality at the point of sale. Mr. W remained dissatisfied with the outcome and referred his complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence provided by Mr. W and Lloyds and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to determine that the car was of unsatisfactory quality at the time of sale. The Ombudsman acknowledged that Mr. W had experienced issues with the car but noted that the car was used and had a higher likelihood of problems than a newer car. The Ombudsman also considered the age, mileage, and price of the car and found that it was likely of satisfactory quality given these factors. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold Mr. W's complaint."

Upon receiving the cards, he disputed their quality and authenticity. Lloyds Bank PLC declined to reimburse him, considering the payment not covered under the CRM Code. Mr. N referred the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service, arguing that he was a victim of fraud.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that it was not more likely than not that Mr. N fell victim to fraud. The seller's actions, such as attempting to address Mr. N's concerns and staying in contact after the payment, did not indicate a clear intention to defraud. Additionally, the absence of red flags or concerns raised prior to the payment suggested that the bank could not have prevented the loss or recovered the funds."

Lloyds provided incorrect information about the recovery and the possibility of making a direct debit indemnity claim, causing Mr M distress and confusion.
