He complained about Lloyds rejecting his complaint about the sale of timeshares. The complaint focused on two timeshare purchases, one in June 2014 and the other in July 2015. Mr. D claimed misrepresentation and unfair sales tactics, alleging that he was pressured into the agreements and that he was unable to use the timeshares as promised.","The Ombudsman considered the relevant laws and regulations, including the Limitation Act 1980, the Consumer Credit Act 1974, and the Financial Conduct Authority's Handbook. The Ombudsman found that Mr. D's claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act for the first timeshare purchase was likely time-barred. Regarding the July 2015 purchase, the Ombudsman found no evidence to support Mr. D's claims of misrepresentation or unfair relationship under sections 56 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC's decision to reject Mr. D's claims was not unreasonable."

In 2008, they were advised to take regular withdrawals from the bond to reduce their IHT liability. After Mr H's death in 2018, Mr S, the Lloyds Bereavement Manager, visited Mrs H to assist with administering the estate. The complainants allege that during this meeting, Mr S advised Mrs H to stop taking withdrawals from the bond to allow it to grow, which they did. Lloyds denied that Mr S gave any financial advice and stated that his role was limited to performing an administrative function only.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's conclusion that it is not likely that Mr S gave financial advice. The Ombudsman considered the evidence and found that it is more likely that Mr S made a statement about Mrs H not needing additional income from the bond from an income point of view, which was not financial advice. The Ombudsman also noted that the complainants did not seek any financial advice or speak to an accountant/actuary before stopping the withdrawals from the bond, and that they should have known that there would be consequences for changing the way of doing things since 2008."

She submitted a complaint to Lloyds under sections 75 and 140A of the Consumer Credit Act 1974, which was rejected.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and arguments and concluded that the complaint should not be upheld. The Ombudsman noted that there was no evidence to support Ms. C's claims of misrepresentation or breach of contract.

Lloyds Bank PLC refused to refund the money, stating that Mrs. A must have been negligent in keeping her PIN safe. Mrs. A complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that it was more likely that Mrs. A had kept a record of her PIN in her purse, which allowed the thief to access her account.

He later realized it was a scam and reported it to Lloyds. Lloyds did not reimburse or recover his funds, prompting him to file a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and determined that Lloyds was not reasonably expected to prevent the payments as they were authorized by Mr. H. While Lloyds should have taken proactive steps to identify and prevent potentially fraudulent transactions, the payments did not appear sufficiently unusual or uncharacteristic to warrant intervention. Additionally, the Ombudsman found that the payments were not recoverable through Lloyds once they had been made as the merchant, Simplex, legitimately provided the intended services."

He contacted Lloyds Bank to make the payment, and although the bank staff were concerned about the transaction, they processed it. Mr P realised he had been scammed when the vehicle wasn't delivered and he couldn't contact the shipping company. He raised the matter with Lloyds, who refunded 50% of his loss but refused to refund the remaining 50%.","The Ombudsman found that Mr P did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the transaction he made was towards a legitimate sale. He took into account the price of the vehicle, the lack of information provided about the seller, the fact that Mr P did not have the opportunity to see the vehicle before he agreed to buy it, and the concerns raised by Lloyds Bank staff. The Ombudsman considered that Mr P should have done more to question the deal and satisfy himself that it was legitimate before making the payment."

She felt she should have been advised against risky investments due to her circumstances. Lloyds agreed the advice was incorrect but compensated her based on a lower risk tolerance than she had. Mrs. R disagreed and escalated the complaint to the ombudsman.","The ombudsman reviewed the case and agreed with Lloyds that Mrs. R was in a strong enough financial position to invest £20,000 in 1998. While she was assessed as having a medium risk tolerance, the investment in the UK Growth fund exposed her to more risk than was suitable. However, the ombudsman considered that Mrs. R should have been advised about the potential volatility and risks involved in investing in such a fund. The 50/50 approach used by Lloyds to calculate redress was deemed reasonable as it reflected a middle ground between no risk and higher risk investments. Therefore, the ombudsman found that Lloyds had provided fair compensation and did not uphold the complaint."

He believes he was the victim of an online dating scam as the people he was communicating with were not real and the website went offline. Lloyds declined to refund the payments stating that Mr. O had authorized the payments and agreed to the merchant's terms and conditions.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the website was operating a scam during the period when the payments were made. The terms and conditions of the website indicated that it was for adult entertainment purposes and that fictitious profiles were used. Mr. O did receive the services he paid for, as evidenced by the exchange of messages with several women. While Mr. O may have been disappointed, there was no evidence of a scam. Furthermore, the payments did not appear unusual compared to Mr. O's regular spending pattern, and therefore, there was no obligation on Lloyds to intervene or prevent the payments."
DRN-3830015,Mr C,Lloyds Bank PLC,Banking,Length of time taken to remove his name from a joint mortgage account and the impact of this on his credit file,Mortgage,"mortgage, credit file, bankruptcy","removal from mortgage account, impact on credit file, compensation",,,dont uphold,Jan O'Leary,6 June 2023,The length of time taken to remove his name from a joint mortgage account with Lloyds Bank PLC and the impact of this on his credit file.,"Mr C says that because of Lloyds error, he had to sell his car, and his credit score is now very poor. Mr C says that this has affected his ability to obtain credit or a mortgage elsewhere.","To settle the complaint, Mr C wants Lloyds to compensate him and offer him and his new partner a mortgage.","Mr C had a mortgage which was held jointly with his former partner. In 2018 he left the mortgaged property. Lloyds wasn't willing to remove him from the mortgage account and said it could only do this if the other party applied, and the request was deemed affordable.
In April 2020 Mr C was declared bankrupt, and was discharged from bankruptcy in April 2021. In April 2022 Lloyds agreed that, because the bankruptcy meant that Mr C had no interest in the property, it would remove him from the account, and did so in April 2022. 
Lloyds acknowledged it could have done this sooner, and agreed to refund Mr Cs legal fees of £3,239 and to pay him compensation of £3,000.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments to decide what's fair and reasonable in the circumstances of this complaint.
There are two aspects to this complaint: whether Lloyds should have removed Mr C from the mortgage sooner than it did, and how the banks actions have (or have not) affected Mr Cs credit profile and thus his ability to obtain credit elsewhere.
Where a mortgage is in joint names and one party asks to be removed from the account a lender is required to consider whether or not the mortgage would be affordable for the other party if it was transferred into their sole name. Lloyds explained this to Mr C in 2019, and I'm satisfied this was the correct response. 
I dont know if Mr Cs former partner made an application for the mortgage to be transferred into their sole name  that person is not a party to this complaint, and so I have no consent to access their personal information. But if there had been an application and Lloyds considered it not to be affordable in their sole name, thats a decision Lloyds would have been entitled to make. If there was no application, thats a decision for Mr Cs former partner.
Mr C believes that if a transfer of the mortgage had taken place in 2019, hed have been entitled to receive £13,000 from the equity in the property. However, Mr C will need to resolve that issue directly with his former partner if he believes that he is entitled to a share of the equity.
After Mr C had been declared bankrupt, Lloyds should have removed him from the mortgage account. I note Lloyds has now acknowledged this, and the bank removed him from the account in April 2022. Im not persuaded, however, that the banks failure to do this sooner has affected Mr Cs ability to raise credit.
I say this because, having looked at Mr Cs credit file, I can see that the bankruptcy has been correctly reported on the credit file by Lloyds. The credit file shows the mortgage as being defaulted on the date of Mr Cs bankruptcy, and the satisfaction date one year later, when he was discharged from bankruptcy. The defaulted account will remain on his credit file for six years from the date of the bankruptcy, and so should not drop off his credit file until April 2026. Im satisfied, therefore, that the information recorded on Mr Cs credit file about the bankruptcy and the effect of this on the mortgage account is correct.
I appreciate Mr Cs point  that if Lloyds had agreed to remove him from the mortgage in 2019 when hed ask the bank to do so, it wouldnt now be reported on his credit file. But as Ive said above, it was up to Mr Cs former partner to apply to the bank for a transfer of the mortgage into their own name. If theyd done that, but the application had been declined on affordability, thats not something I can ask Lloyds to change, or backdate. If Mr Cs former partner hadnt made an application, thats not something thats within the control of Lloyds, or anything that this service can become involved with; its between Mr C and his former partner.
In the circumstances, Im satisfied that the mortgage is being correctly reported on Mr Cs credit file. I fully appreciate that this has affected the type of credit and the interest rates available to him. But lenders are entitled to know the financial history of someone applying for credit, including any previous bankruptcy. Therefore, even if Lloyds had removed Mr C from the mortgage account in April 2020 (when he was declared bankrupt) or April 2021 (when his bankruptcy was discharged), the bankruptcy itself would still have shown up on his credit file, and will continue to do so until April 2026."

Lloyds Bank PLC reassessed the PPI policies and provided further compensation. Ms C was not satisfied with the reassessment and brought the complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.,"The Ombudsman reviewed the evidence and determined that Lloyds Bank PLC had followed the correct method in calculating Ms C's PPI compensation. The Ombudsman explained that for a chain of loans, the compensation includes refunding extra payments made for PPI premiums, associated interest and charges, and any leftover PPI that was wrapped up into subsequent loans. The Ombudsman also clarified that Lloyds Bank PLC had already refunded the PPI for certain loans in 2010 and those decisions remained unchanged. The Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC had offered fair compensation to Ms C."

They felt this caused them financial disadvantage as interest rates had increased. Lloyds maintained that the charges were clearly outlined and that other options were available, such as remortgaging elsewhere.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds had clearly communicated the terms and conditions of the mortgage, including the early repayment charges. While acknowledging the inconvenience faced by Mr. and Mrs. C, the Ombudsman considered that they were not being treated differently from other customers and that the charges were not punitive but a way for lenders to cover costs and risks."

Despite suggestions for alternative solutions, the bank decided not to proceed with the account opening. Mrs. F felt this decision was discriminatory and caused her distress.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank had reasonable concerns about Mrs. F's mental capacity based on the interaction during the meeting. However, the bank could have managed its decision more empathetically and ensured a more appropriate closure of the meeting.

She later contacted Lloyds Bank PLC to request a refund, claiming that she had been scammed and did not receive what she had paid for. Lloyds Bank PLC investigated the complaint and concluded that Miss S had received the photos she had paid for and therefore could not process a chargeback.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC did not act unfairly in the way it handled Miss S's request for a refund. The Ombudsman noted that the supplier was able to provide evidence that Miss S received what she had paid for and that Miss S provided misleading information about whether she recognised the transaction and had authorised it. The Ombudsman also considered the fact that even if Lloyds Bank PLC had used a different reason for the chargeback, it would still likely have failed due to the supplier's evidence."

Mr P has given a number of reasons why he says that the accounts were mis-sold. These include that he says that many of benefits were not suitable for his needs or were later removed but the price stayed the same. Mr P says he was unable to claim on many of the products due to his employment. He also says he was told that having the accounts would improve his chances of getting an overdraft and obtaining loans. The complaint was referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service after Lloyds did not uphold the complaint.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that it is more likely that Mr P agreed to the packaged accounts because he was attracted to some of the benefits that they provided, rather than because he thought he needed them to obtain further credit.

The Ombudsman noted that the details on the application matched Miss H's genuine details and were consistent with information held by Lloyds from another account she holds within the same banking group. The Ombudsman also considered the possibility of a third party being responsible but found it difficult to understand how they could have obtained all of Miss H's personal information and successfully intercepted all the post related to the loan for almost a year.

She complained to Lloyds and they agreed that she had been misinformed and paid her £100 in compensation, but they were unable to amend the minimum payment amount. The Ombudsman upheld the complaint and recommended that Lloyds pay Miss W a further £1606.45 in compensation to cover the difference between the 1% minimum payment she thought she would be paying and the 2.5% minimum payment she will be required to pay over the 21 month interest free period. Lloyds also agreed to pay Miss W £250 for distress and inconvenience.",The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and thought that the offer made by Lloyds was fair and reasonable and in line with what they had recommended.

Despite submitting the required information, his application was declined in February 2022 due to affordability concerns. He complained about the delay and the decision, leading to an investigation and review by the ombudsman.","The ombudsman found that while the bank's decision to decline the loan application based on affordability was reasonable, there were significant delays in processing the application. The ombudsman considered that Mr. M was put to avoidable inconvenience and distress due to the delay and lack of updates from the bank.

Lloyds refunded half of the first two payments (£2,616) and paid an additional £100 compensation for service issues. Mr and Mrs T complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service when Lloyds refused to refund the remaining amount.","The Ombudsman found that Mr T did not have a reasonable basis for believing that his payments were for genuine goods or services, or that the person or business with whom he transacted was legitimate.

He later faced difficulties in repaying the loan and made settlement offers, which the bank did not respond to. Mr. N argued that the loan should have been in the name of an LLP, not his sole trader name. The bank acknowledged communication issues but maintained that the loan was set up correctly based on the application.","The Ombudsman found that while there were communication issues on the bank's part, they did not significantly impact the outcome. The Ombudsman considered the fact that the loan was used by Mr. N's business and that he had acknowledged liability through his actions. The Ombudsman concluded that it would not be fair to write off the loan based on the LLP issue, as the funds were utilized by the business."

Lloyds apologized and offered him £30 as compensation, which he rejected.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Lloyds Bank acted reasonably in blocking the payment due to potential fraud concerns. He also found that Lloyds responded appropriately by lifting the block after verifying the payment and that the £30 compensation offered was fair for the inconvenience caused.

Mr. E complained that this was unfair as he believed he had sufficient means to repay the borrowing and had a good payment history. Lloyds explained that they regularly review credit limits and based on their assessment, they found it may have been difficult for Mr. E to repay the amount he was borrowing. They also conducted a financial review in January 2023 but were unable to increase the limit due to adverse information on Mr. E's credit file.",The Ombudsman agreed with Lloyds Bank's decision as the terms and conditions of Mr. E's credit card account allowed the bank to change the credit limit at any time. The bank followed the correct process by informing Mr. E about the reduction on the same day and providing a reason for it. The Ombudsman also acknowledged that Lloyds conducted a financial review and explained the reasons for not being able to increase the credit limit at that time.

Due to the delay, they had to opt for a different product with a higher interest rate of 3.69% fixed until January 2026.","The Ombudsman acknowledged the inconvenience faced by Miss B and Mr. S but concluded that Lloyds Bank was not at fault. The high call volume during that period was attributed to external factors, such as the mini-budget announcement, which led to market turmoil and increased demand for mortgage products. The Ombudsman also clarified that a formal application for the desired rate was never made before it was withdrawn, and therefore, Lloyds was not obligated to offer it."

Lloyds said it carried out credit checks and did not find any evidence to suggest that Mr. D would not be able to repay the overdraft.",The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Lloyds did not act irresponsibly in approving Mr. D's overdraft and increasing the limit.

He complained about the inconvenience caused, the time and frustration he had to go through, and the initial refusal to return the original cheque. Lloyds Bank Plc offered £100 in compensation, which Mr P considered insufficient.","The Ombudsman considered that Lloyds Bank Plc was right to reject the cheque as it was not made out to the company's name. The Ombudsman also considered that C did not suffer a financial loss as the disputed amount was eventually paid into the company's account. The Ombudsman acknowledged that C suffered inconvenience due to poor customer service, but found that the £100 compensation offered by Lloyds Bank Plc was fair and reasonable. The Ombudsman also clarified that Lloyds Bank Plc is not required to share copies of all its internal policies with Mr P or publish them on the internet."

Lloyds maintained their position based on a business decision not to pay interest on such accounts. The trustees argued that this was unfair and sought a solution that would allow them to benefit from the increased balance.,"The Ombudsman considered the terms and conditions of the account, which made no reference to interest payment. While sympathizing with the trustees' position, the Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds had not given any undertaking to pay interest and that their decision not to do so was a matter of commercial judgment. The Ombudsman also acknowledged Lloyds' suggestion of an alternative interest-earning savings account as a reasonable way to address the trustees' concerns."

They asked Lloyds to refund these payments, but Lloyds declined, stating that they had provided sufficient warnings about the payments. The complaint was referred to the Ombudsman for a decision.","The Ombudsman agreed with Lloyds that they had provided sufficient warnings about the payments and that Mr and Ms P had authorized the payments themselves. While some of the payments were flagged as unusual, Lloyds had asked probing questions and Mr and Ms P had answered them in a way that led Lloyds to believe that the payments were legitimate. The Ombudsman also considered whether Lloyds could have done more to recover the funds after the fraud was reported, but found that there were no funds remaining in Mr and Ms P's crypto wallet for the bank to recover."

Lloyds Bank PLC responded to his concerns and explained their policies, but Mr A remained dissatisfied. He then filed a complaint with the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman reviewed the terms and conditions of Mr A's credit card account and found that Lloyds Bank PLC had acted within those terms. The Ombudsman also noted that Lloyds Bank PLC had refunded the interest charges for September, October, and November 2022 as a gesture of goodwill, and had applied interest waivers until January 2023.

He had sent certified copies of his identification documents but the bank had no record of receiving them. He was also frustrated with the delay in receiving one-time passcodes, which prevented him from accessing his account online.","The Ombudsman considered that Lloyds Bank had a duty to mitigate security risks and that requiring Mr. N to verify his identity before removing the dormancy marker was not unreasonable. The process for submitting certified copies of identity documents by post was deemed acceptable, even though Mr. N claimed to have already sent them. The delay in receiving one-time passcodes was acknowledged as frustrating but was not considered to have made a material difference in the situation. Therefore, the Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank had followed its process for dormant accounts and treated Mr. N fairly."

Lloyds Bank PLC refunded some of the charges that Miss O had been charged, but she was not satisfied with this and brought her complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.","The Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank PLC had not acted fairly and reasonably in continuing to charge Miss O overdraft interest and associated fees after it had increased her overdraft limit on one of her accounts. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds Bank PLC should not have approved Miss O for an overdraft on her second account as she was already struggling to manage her existing overdraft.

The Ombudsman also clarified that interest rates are subject to change and that the adviser correctly advised Mr and Miss G based on the current rates at the time of their appointment. However, he found that Lloyds Bank provided incorrect information about the possibility of applying historical interest rates, which led to confusion and disappointment for Mr and Miss G.

The seller turned out to be a scammer and disappeared with the money. Lloyds Bank PLC refused to refund Mrs. K's money, citing her lack of a reasonable basis for believing the transaction was legitimate.","The Ombudsman agreed with Lloyds Bank PLC's decision not to refund Mrs. K's money.

After realizing he was scammed, he raised a complaint with Lloyds, claiming they should have stopped the payments.","The Ombudsman agreed with the investigator's conclusion that the payments were not sufficiently out of character to warrant an intervention by Lloyds. The payments were authorized by Mr. D using his legitimate security credentials, and there was no obligation on Lloyds to intervene further. While the first four transactions triggered Lloyds to confirm their genuineness, the overall circumstances did not indicate that Mr. D was being scammed. Additionally, a chargeback for the debit card payments or the Contingency Reimbursement Model for the bank transfer would not have been successful in recovering the lost funds."

Lloyds Bank PLC, the complainant's bank, declined to refund the lost amount, citing the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code, which allows banks not to reimburse APP scam losses in certain situations.","The Ombudsman determined that the complainant did not have a reasonable basis for believing that the payment was legitimate, as there were several indicators of potential fraud that were overlooked. Therefore, Lloyds Bank PLC was not liable to refund the lost amount under the CRM Code.

Mrs J believes she was scammed and that Lloyds Bank PLC should reimburse her under the CRM Code.","The Ombudsman found that there was not enough evidence to conclude that the seller was not legitimate and had set out to defraud Mrs J.

The complainant argues that Mrs. S would have been better off keeping the second charge loan as it was on a repayment basis and would have been repaid by the end of its term. However, the Ombudsman finds that the additional borrowing likely reduced Mrs. S's monthly outgoings and did not put her in a worse financial position. Regarding the handling of arrears, the Ombudsman finds that Lloyds Bank PLC remained in contact with Mrs. S, offered short-term payment plans, and put recovery action on hold when requested. While Mrs. S was vulnerable due to health problems and financial difficulties, the Ombudsman considers that Lloyds Bank PLC acted reasonably and does not find it responsible for Mrs. S's financial difficulties or the stress and worry she experienced.","The Ombudsman considers that the additional borrowing in 2008 did not result in financial loss or cause Mrs. S's financial difficulties.

The Ombudsman considered several red flags in the investment opportunity, including the unsolicited nature of the offer, lack of regulatory registrations, implausible share prices, and suspicious tax demands.

Mrs. A holds Lloyds responsible for the conveyancers' actions and the resulting negative impact on her health and finances.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and concluded that Lloyds Bank PLC is not responsible for the actions or omissions of the conveyancing firm as they are a separate and independent third party. While Lloyds may have introduced Mrs. A to the conveyancing firm, there was no obligation for her to use their services. The documentation provided clearly states the independent nature of the conveyancers. Although Lloyds has taken steps to assist Mrs. A and forward her complaint to the conveyancing firm, the Ombudsman does not find it fair and reasonable to hold Lloyds liable for the conveyancers' actions."

Lloyds did not investigate the complaint within the relevant time limits, but the Financial Ombudsman Service decided to look into it.",The Ombudsman found that Lloyds failed to carry out reasonable and proportionate checks before increasing the credit limit in June 2011 and subsequent increases. Mr J's bank statements showed that he had a serious gambling problem and was overly reliant on credit. The Ombudsman concluded that the lending decisions were unfair and upheld the complaint.

It was established that D set up an account for Mr H with T, and Mr H provided his card details to fund the investment account.

Therefore, the Ombudsman recommended that Lloyds pay a further 50% of the third payment Miss S made as part of the scam (plus interest at the savings account rate).

They complained to Lloyds, arguing that the removal of the fee-waiver was a breach of contract and that the account had been mis-sold to them.","The Ombudsman considered the arguments presented by both sides and concluded that Lloyds was entitled to remove the fee-waiver feature from the Gold account as the account terms and conditions contained a variation clause that allowed the bank to make changes to the cost or benefits of the account, provided sufficient notice was given.

Although the letters regarding the account closure and the new Loan Servicing Account were not received by R, the Ombudsman was satisfied that Lloyds Bank PLC followed the correct procedures.

S claims to have made multiple follow-up calls during the 90-day period but faced conflicting information and delays. The account was eventually opened in September 2022 after S resubmitted the application. S alleges that the delay caused them to miss out on funding opportunities.","The Ombudsman found that while there were some communication issues and delays on Lloyds' part, S also contributed to the delay by not promptly following up on the application after the initial call. The Ombudsman considered the compensation already provided by Lloyds to be fair and reasonable and did not require any further action from the bank."

Some of the flooring was damaged upon arrival, and Mr. B sought a refund from the supplier, Business 1. After unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with the supplier, Mr. B contacted Lloyds Bank, which raised a chargeback and applied a temporary credit to his account. Business 1 defended the claim, and Lloyds Bank chose not to escalate the matter to arbitration. Mr. B received a partial refund of £935.88 from Business 1 and initiated legal proceedings against them for the remaining amount. He complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service about Lloyds Bank's handling of the chargeback claim.","The Ombudsman considered the available evidence and determined that Lloyds Bank had sent an email to Mr. B on January 12, 2023, informing him of the status of the chargeback and the need for further action. While Mr. B claimed not to have received the email, the Ombudsman found that Lloyds Bank had fulfilled its communication obligations. The Ombudsman also noted that even if Mr. B had provided additional information on or around January 12, 2023, it was unlikely to have changed the outcome of the dispute in his favor. Therefore, the Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint and declined to direct Lloyds Bank to refund the interest charged on Mr. B's overdrawn account."

Lloyds Bank PLC, their bank, declined to refund them fully, arguing that they had not exercised reasonable caution in making the payments. The Ombudsman found that Lloyds was not liable for the first two payments as they occurred before the Contingent Reimbursement Model (CRM) Code came into effect and that the bank had acted reasonably in allowing the subsequent payments based on the information provided by Mr S.",The Ombudsman considered that Lloyds Bank PLC was not required to refund more than the 50% it had already paid Mr S and Miss T under the CRM Code. The Ombudsman also found that Lloyds Bank PLC was not at fault in not intervening again in relation to the later payments and that it had taken appropriate steps in attempting to recover the payments.

They also complained that Lloyds delayed processing cheques they had issued. An investigation revealed that Ms E gained access to the complainants' main account through internet banking after she was made a full power signatory to an additional business account. The complainants claimed that they were not aware of the implications of this action and that the bank did not make it sufficiently clear. Lloyds argued that the forms provided clearly explained the consequences of making Ms E a full power signatory and that the complainants had signed the mandate without questioning its wording.","The Ombudsman acknowledged that Lloyds handled Ms E's online banking application in accordance with its procedures. However, the Ombudsman found that the bank did not make it sufficiently clear to the complainants that giving Ms E full power signatory rights to the additional account would allow her to use internet banking to access the main account. Regarding the delayed cheques, the Ombudsman considered the payments unusual and acknowledged the bank's caution in taking security measures. While the Ombudsman agreed with the bank that the complainants signed the mandate form, it was determined that the bank could have done more to clarify the implications of making Ms E a full power signatory. The Ombudsman awarded the complainants £500 for the distress they suffered as a result of the data breach."

Despite some interventions by Lloyds, Mr. A's dishonest answers during those calls prevented the scam from being discovered. Lloyds argues that it could not have retrieved the money or helped Mr. A recover his losses.","The Ombudsman acknowledges that Lloyds should have intervened earlier, specifically on a payment of £8,200 on 30th July 2022. However, based on Mr. A's dishonest answers during intervention calls, the Ombudsman concludes that an earlier intervention would not have likely succeeded in discovering the scam.

Lloyds Bank held Mr R liable for the payment, as it was made using his mobile app, login details, and biometrics. Mr R appealed the decision, arguing that another mobile device had been registered before the payment. The Ombudsman investigated the complaint and found that the new device was set up with Mr R's consent and that he was aware of it at the time. The Ombudsman also noted that the disputed payment was funded by a large credit into Mr R's account shortly beforehand, which suggests that the person who made the payment knew about the incoming credit.","The Ombudsman considered all the available evidence and arguments and concluded that there was not a likely or plausible way that the payment could have been made without Mr R's consent. Therefore, the Ombudsman found that it was fair for Lloyds Bank to hold Mr R liable for the payment."

Due to a change in circumstances, he cancelled the order within 14 days, but the supplier failed to refund the deposit. He raised a section 75 claim with Lloyds, which was declined.","The Ombudsman found that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the supplier breached the contract by failing to return the deposit within the 14-day cancellation period. The supplier's text message suggested that Mr. C had canceled after the 14-day period, and Mr. C's initial claim to Lloyds indicated that he had contacted the supplier in March 2022, which would have been outside the cancellation period."

He believes Lloyds should have identified that the cheques were payable to himself and not a security risk. He also criticizes Lloyds' internal checking procedures and claims to have lost interest because of the delay in processing his cheque.,"The Ombudsman considered the evidence and found that Lloyds had legitimate security concerns in stopping the cheque due to the significant difference between Mr. T's signature on the cheque and the one on record. While acknowledging the inconvenience caused to Mr. T, the Ombudsman concluded that Lloyds' actions were fair and reasonable in the circumstances. The Ombudsman also noted that Lloyds had paid £50 to Mr. T as a gesture of goodwill."

Lloyds declined the claim, stating that there was no valid debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in place. Mr. R disputed this decision and the complaint was referred to the Ombudsman.","The Ombudsman agreed with Lloyds that there was no debtor-creditor-supplier agreement in place between Mr. R and Lloyds, as the payment for the holiday club membership was not made directly to Business H using Mr. R's credit card. The Ombudsman also considered the unfair relationship argument but found no unfairness in the debtor-creditor relationship between Mr. R and Lloyds.

The complainants felt they were not informed about this issue earlier, causing them stress and financial difficulties.","The Ombudsman acknowledged Lloyds' initial poor service and offered £150 as compensation. However, the main issue arose from the mortgage advisor's failure to communicate the property details accurately, which could have resulted in an earlier decision from Lloyds. While Lloyds was entitled to rely on the valuation report, the delay in identifying the property's status caused unnecessary distress to Mr. B and Mrs. L.

The bank was not under any obligation to refund the payment under the Contingent Reimbursement Model Code as the payment was made before the code came into force and did not apply to cheques.

He had the fault repaired at a garage on the same day and contacted Lloyds Bank to request assistance in recovering the cost of the repair. Lloyds Bank declined to submit a chargeback claim on Mr. R's behalf, citing the limitation of the Visa chargeback rules. Mr. R complained to the Financial Ombudsman Service, arguing that he was unable to return the car to the garage and that Lloyds Bank should have submitted a chargeback claim on his behalf.","The Ombudsman considered the evidence and arguments presented by both parties and concluded that Lloyds Bank acted fairly and reasonably in not raising a chargeback on Mr. R's behalf. The Ombudsman noted that chargebacks are not decided on the merits of the dispute between the cardholder and merchant, but rather on the relevant card schemes rules. In this case, the guidelines set by VISA did not allow for a chargeback in this situation.
